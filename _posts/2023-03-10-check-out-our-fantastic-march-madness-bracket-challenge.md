It’s my favorite time of the year: March Madness! For those who don’t know, this is the nickname for the NCAA Men’s basketball tournament. Only the best teams get in; once you lose, you’re out for good.&nbsp;

As you may know, fans of the tournament often fill out brackets before the event begins to try and predict who they think will be the champion team. **To honor this tradition, I’m proud to announce that my team is hosting a March Madness tournament bracket challenge!** Whoever fills out the best bracket will win a prize of $100, second place will receive $50, and third place gets $25.&nbsp;

You don’t have to be an expert to participate in this event; in fact, my experience tells me that the less you know about basketball, the better you’ll do. **No matter what happens, this will be a fantastic time, so click here to register.&nbsp;**

As always, call or email me with any questions. I am always willing to help!
