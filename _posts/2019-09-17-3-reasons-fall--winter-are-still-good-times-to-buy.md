Despite the fact that the fall market tends to slow after the rush of the summer. There are still multiple reasons why this time of year is a great time to buy a home:

**1\. Sellers are more motivated in the fall.** Compared to those in the spring and summer, fall home sellers have more motivation to sell. No one wants strangers traipsing through their home during the Thanksgiving season\!

There are also fewer homes on the market. Looking at the numbers, in January of 2019, there were 1,530 closed residential transactions in our MLS. &nbsp;In May this year, that number was 2,992; and the months of June, July, and August were all about the same, at 2,700.

**2\. You’ll have more of your agent’s attention.** Summer is always more busy for real estate agents. Keeping track of all the activity is more challenging because there's twice as much work in the summer. But in the fall and winter, when activity slows down, it’s easier for your agent to devote more of their attention to you.

**3\. The weather.** Sweating through the afternoon looking at houses just isn't fun\! &nbsp;When things get a bit more cool and breezy it makes the house hunting process much more enjoyable.

If you have any questions about buying a home in the fall, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you out.
