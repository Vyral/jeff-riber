Despite the fact that the fall market tends to slow after the rush of the summer, there are still three key reasons why the fall and winter markets are still great times to buy a home:

**1\. Sellers are more motivated in the fall.** Compared to those in the spring and summer, fall home sellers have more motivation to sell. No one wants strangers traipsing through their home during the Thanksgiving season when you’ll have lots of family and friends around\! There are also fewer homes on the market, so they need to be serious. Looking at the numbers in January of 2019, there were 1,530 closed residential transactions in our MLS; in May this year, that number was 2,992; and the months of June, July, and August were all about the same, at 2,700.

**2\. You’ll have more of your agent’s attention.** This summer has been busy for me and many other agents. It’s hard to keep track of all the logistics of the various transactions we’re involved with during the summer since that’s when most of them occur. But in the fall and winter, when activity slows down, it’s easier for your agent to devote their attention to your specific transaction and regularly communicate with you.

**3\. The weather.** Fall and winter are the best times to get quotes for building a pool, and no one wants to run around looking at houses when it’s 97 degrees out\! In Jacksonville, the fall and winter temperatures tend to hover around 72 degrees, which is excellent house-hunting weather.
