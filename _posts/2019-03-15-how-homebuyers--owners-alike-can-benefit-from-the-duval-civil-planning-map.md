Today I’ll give you a quick rundown of the Duval Civil Planning Map, which can be found online at [http://http://maps.coj.net/duvalcivilplanning/](http://http://maps.coj.net/duvalcivilplanning/){: .cc-active target="_blank"}, and talk to you about some of the nifty features you’ll find there.&nbsp;

There are a few reasons you might want to harness the power of this tool for your home buying pursuits:&nbsp;

**1. In the event of a natural disaster, you’ll know how high your home’s elevation is.** By using this map, you’ll be able to ascertain the elevation of your potential home and, therefore, determine whether the home would be underwater if a natural disaster were to strike. It will also give you an idea of how high the home sits relative to your neighbors.&nbsp;

**2. You can decide where to go in the event of a storm.** Relatedly, you can rely on this tool if and when you’re in the path of a storm. If circumstances dictate that you need to evacuate and seek shelter elsewhere, the map will give you a sense of the elevation of your relatives’ properties as well. In turn, you can determine whose is the highest and head that direction.&nbsp;

**3. You can see how to best landscape your yard.** If it’s time to restructure your yard’s landscaping or, say, you have a recurring issue with runoff in just one spot, this tool can aid you in mapping out how to eliminate the problem, given your home’s elevation.&nbsp;
