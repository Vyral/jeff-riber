Today we're going to take a break from hard-hitting real estate information and instead look at my top five favorite healthy lunch spots.

**1\. [Whole Foods.](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/jacksonville){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** I like their combination salad and hot bar. For $10.99 per pound (or something close to that), you can get a great salad and add chicken and veggies to make a complete lunch.

**2\. [Kairos.](https://www.kairosjuices.com/menu#menu=lunch-and-dinner){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**&nbsp;It’s in a retail shopping just west of Hodges Blvd on the north side of Beach Boulevard. They have a lot of great stuff on the menu, but I love their Kairos Quesadilla.

**3\. [Juice Tap.](https://www.juicetapjax.com/menu){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** They have tasty salads and juices that are also budget-conscious. My favorite is the veggie-filled greek salad.

**4\. [Southern Roots Filling Station.](https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/southern-roots-filling-station-1275-king-st-jacksonville/1084948)** If you're in the Riverside Avondale area, check out this vegan restaurant. My favorite item they have is their quinoa and avocado protein bowl.

**5\. [True Food.](https://www.truefoodkitchen.com/menu/)** This is a slightly more formal lunch gathering spot in the town center. My favorite item is the turkey burger.

If you know a healthy lunch spot, I would love to hear it so that I can put it in our rotation. If you have any real estate questions, reach out to 904-405-1995 or [jeff@era.com](mailto:jeff@era.com). I look forward to hearing from you.
