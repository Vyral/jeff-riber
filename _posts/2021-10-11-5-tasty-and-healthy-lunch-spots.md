Today we're going to take a break from hard-hitting real estate information and instead look at my top five favorite healthy lunch spots.

**1\. Whole Foods.** I like their combination salad and hot bar. For $10.99 per pound, you can get a great salad and add chicken and veggies to make a complete lunch.

**2\. Kairos.** It's in the shopping center north of Beach Boulevard. They have a lot of great stuff on the menu, but I love their quesadilla.

**3\. Juice Tap.** They have tasty salads and juices that are also budget-conscious. My favorite is the veggie-filled greek salad.

**4\. Southern Roots Filling Station.** If you're in the Riverside Avondale area, check out this vegan restaurant. My favorite item they have is their quinoa and avocado protein bowl.

**5\. True Food.** This is a slightly more formal lunch gathering spot in the town center. My favorite item is the turkey burger.

If you know a healthy lunch spot, I would love to hear it so that I can put it in our lunch rotation. If you have any real estate questions, reach out to 904-405-1995 or [jeff@era.com](mailto:jeff@era.com). I look forward to hearing from you.
