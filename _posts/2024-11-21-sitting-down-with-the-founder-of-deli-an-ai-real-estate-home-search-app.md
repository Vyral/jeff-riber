Can you find your dream home in seconds, tailored perfectly to your needs, without the hassle of endless clicking and scrolling? Yes! That’s the future of real estate search, and it’s here now. I recently sat down with[<u>Lyman Starmer</u>](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lymanstarmer/), the visionary founder of[<u>Deli</u>](https://usedeli.com/), to explore how his groundbreaking AI technology is reshaping the way we discover homes.

*“Think of Deli as ChatGPT but for real estate,”* Lyman explained. **Deli is an AI property search tool that integrates directly into brokerage websites**, revolutionizing how consumers find their ideal homes. Instead of navigating through outdated drop-down menus and filters, users can simply converse with Deli, describing precisely what they want.

**The problem with traditional real estate searches.** For years, homebuyers have relied on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) and Internet Data Exchange (IDX) to search for properties. These platforms often require numerous clicks and manual filtering, which can take 30 minutes or more to find suitable listings. *“Before Deli, finding your dream home could be tedious,”* Lyman noted. *“Our goal was to eliminate the friction and make home searching an enjoyable, efficient experience.”*

**How Deli enhances the home-buying experience.** With Deli, users can type in natural language requests like, “Looking for a home under $750,000 that needs to have two acres and a brick exterior.” Deli instantly processes these criteria and presents matching properties in seconds.

Not only does this save time, but it also ensures that buyers don’t miss out on potential homes due to inconsistencies in listing data. Deli analyzes property descriptions and photos and even detects discrepancies where a listing agent might have omitted key features like a pool.

*“At the end of the day, we want it to feel as if you’re not talking to AI—you’re just talking to somebody else,”* Lyman emphasized.

**What’s next for Deli?** Deli isn’t stopping at simplifying property searches. Future updates aim to make the tool even more intuitive, allowing users to search for homes near specific schools, restaurants, or amenities. The goal is to respond in a conversational form, asking clarifying questions like, “I know you want to be near a school, but what does that mean to you—two miles or 500 feet?”

Additionally, Deli plans to expand into rental properties, making it easier for renters to find the perfect home by simply stating their budget, desired amenities, and living arrangements.

As Deli continues to evolve, it’s clear that AI is set to revolutionize the real estate industry by making home searches more personalized and efficient.
