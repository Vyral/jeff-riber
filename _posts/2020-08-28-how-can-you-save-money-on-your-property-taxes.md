<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s how you can save money on your property taxes.</em></p>

If you’re wondering how to save money on your property taxes, there are a couple of ways to do so.

First, **you could always let someone else do it.** There are several companies (<u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.firstcoastconsultants.com/">First Coast Consultants</a></u>, for example) dedicated to helping you lower your property taxes. Their primary focus is larger commercial properties, but they can help you as well, provided you’re willing to pay a fee.

Second, **establish that you have a discrepancy.** If you can prove that the county is assessing your property for more than it’s worth, and thus charging you more in taxes than what you should be paying, then they’ll lower the value—and by extension, your taxes. If you decide on this option, give me a call; I’d be happy to craft a market analysis to help you state your case.

Third, once a discrepancy is established, **know when to act.** August has just ended, so you should’ve received a notice of proposed taxes from the county by now telling you what they intend to tax you on this November. This means right now is the time to act if you want to contest your property’s valuation. You can <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.coj.net/departments/regulatory-boards-and-commissions/value-adjustment-board">contact the Value Adjustment Board</a></u> either through the online form or by sending them an email. &nbsp;There offices are presently closed due to COVID-19.

Finally, **remember to fill out the proper paperwork.** Make sure you fill out the petition form completely and correctly when contesting your assessed value. There’s a slight fee involved, but it’s well worth it if you can save thousands of dollars later.

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m happy to help.
