People always ask if I know a good plumber, roofer, or painter I can refer to them. So today, I’d like to break down the process our team follows to find high-quality contractors. By following this process yourself, you’ll be sure to find the right contractor for your needs in no time.&nbsp;

This process contains four simple steps:&nbsp;

**1\. Look for contractors** by talking to friends and family, by looking online, or by reaching out to trusted local professionals, like your Realtor. Once you’ve identified a few candidates, you can move on to the next step.

Here are some websites to locate professionals:

**2\. Fact-checking.** Before you even think of hiring a contractor, you need to make sure they’re licensed, insured, and that they pull the proper permits when handling various projects. This will give you a better idea of their legitimacy.

**3\. Create a competition between the vendors you’re thinking of hiring.** When a contractor knows they aren’t your only option, this may incentivize them to put their best foot forward. Not only that, but comparison shopping is a great way to ensure you earn the best possible deal.&nbsp;

**4\. Don’t pay for the entire job up front.** While you should certainly expect to pay a deposit when you begin working with a contractor, paying the entire bill before the work is finished is not a wise choice.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
