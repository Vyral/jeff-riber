**What Home Renovations Really Add Value?** 🛠️💰

One of the questions I get asked the most—whether it’s from homeowners thinking about selling or those just curious—is:

**“What renovations actually add value to my home?”**

Or more specifically,

**“If I do** ***this*** **project, how much return will I get?”**

These are great questions—and I hear them almost every week.

**The Big Picture** 🏠

Let’s break it down: some improvements *do* add real value, and some... not so much. Knowing the difference can save (or make) you thousands.

Recently, the Florida Association of Realtors published an article on top kitchen trends. Their data showed that homeowners typically recover about **75%** of the cost of a kitchen overhaul when they sell. That’s one of the better returns on investment (ROI) out there.

But hold on...

**Not All Stats Are Created Equal** 🤔

You’ve probably heard the quote, *“80% of statistics are made up.”* That kind of applies here.

I looked at multiple sources, including the **Journal of Light Construction**, which listed **garage doors, steel entry doors, and stone veneer** as the only upgrades that consistently return more than a dollar-for-dollar ROI.

Then there’s HomeWyse (W-Y-S-E)—a handy site where you can explore costs and potential value added in your specific zip code.

And of course, these days you can also just ask **ChatGPT or Google Gemini** to pull localized ROI estimates on any project you're considering. 📲

**My Real-World Take: Strategic Renovations Win** 🧩

Here’s where I think most homeowners *really* get the biggest bang for their buck:

Let’s say you remodel your **kitchen** and spend $30,000. You might only get $20,000–$25,000 back when you sell. That’s typical.

But...

**What if** you do a few other things too—like new **flooring**, updated **fixtures**, some **paint**, maybe a few **electrical or plumbing** upgrades?

Now we’re talking.

When you *layer* these projects, you create a **total home experience** that buyers value *more* than the sum of its parts. You’re not just improving the home—you’re eliminating the hassle for the next owner.

Because let’s be real: coordinating multiple renovations while living in the home? It’s a pain. 🧼🪚😩

**The Hassle Factor = Hidden Value**

When buyers walk into a home where all the work is done—kitchen, floors, paint, lighting—they're not just valuing the finishes. They’re valuing the *fact that they don’t have to do it themselves.*

That’s where you often get back more than you spent—because you’ve improved not just the home, but the buyer’s experience.

**Little Things Still Matter** 🌿

Of course, not every project has to be big. **Deep cleaning, landscaping, and minor touch-ups** often add more value than they cost. But if you're planning bigger upgrades, **tie them together** strategically for maximum impact.
