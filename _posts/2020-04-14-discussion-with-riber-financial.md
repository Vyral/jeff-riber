Today Blake Riber, owner of Riber Financial, joins me on Facebook Live to discuss the Small Business Administration (SBA) program and the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) rollout for stimulus funds. One of the most frequent questions we’re hearing from people right now is how to access the money from these programs to keep their businesses operating. There is $349 billion available for small businesses. If you’re a small business with 500 or fewer employees, you’re most likely eligible to receive funds. The government will take your average monthly 2019 salary costs from your company, multiply it by 2.5%, and that’s your loan base. To learn more about these programs, watch my latest video above.&nbsp;
