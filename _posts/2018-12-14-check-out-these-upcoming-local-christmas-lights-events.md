Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and Happy New Year!

Our team has a couple of exciting points to share in today’s message, so let’s dive right in. First of all, **the first three people who respond to this post through email, Facebook, or using any of our other social media platforms will receive a small (but heartfelt) gift from our team.**

Next, we would like to make you aware of some great upcoming opportunities to view Christmas lights in our area. We were originally going to compile a list of each event ourselves, but we found a few sources that already had done so, so we’ve decided to share these with you, instead.
