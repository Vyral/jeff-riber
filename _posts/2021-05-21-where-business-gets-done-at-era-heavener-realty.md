Today I’ll show you where business gets done at ERA Heavener Realty. I’ll take you on an exclusive “MTV Cribs” tour of our office building in Jacksonville. In addition to each team member's office, you’ll see our kitchen and dining area and check out some local art we’ve adorned our walls with. You’ll also get a chance to see me prove the naysayers who claim I’m a terrible golfer wrong 😎.

If you ever have any real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to put my team’s resources to work for you.
