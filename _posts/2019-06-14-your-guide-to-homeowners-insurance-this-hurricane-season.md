Now that we’ve entered hurricane season here in Florida, it’s time for you to review your homeowners insurance and make sure you have the right coverage in case disaster strikes.&nbsp;

With that in mind, I’ve invited Danny Sands of Brightway Insurance to go over this topic with me in today’s Facebook Live interview. Danny has been in the insurance business for about a decade, and Brightway is recognized as the No. 1 broker in the state for homeowners insurance. Aside from that, they also sell life, auto, and business insurance.&nbsp;
