How can you save money on your next real estate purchase or refinance? The mortgage interest rate buydown option. Let's look at that, what it is, and a scenario for how you could make it work for you.

So what is it? **It's essentially a trade between you, the borrower, and your bank or mortgage company, the entity lending you the money for the house.** You will trade them some additional cash upfront for a lower mortgage interest rate and, therefore, a lower mortgage payment.&nbsp;

So what does that mean practically? When mortgage interest rates were very low in the last few years, the rate buydown relationship wasn't good. Essentially, the amount of cash you had to give your bank or mortgage company upfront and what they were willing to reduce the mortgage interest rate by just didn't really play out. It didn't make sense. Now that mortgage interest rates have gone up a bit, the relationship between the cash you give the lender upfront and their willingness to reduce the mortgage interest rate has improved for borrowers.

**Let’s say you have a $500,000 loan**, and your credit score is 780. You’re putting 10% down, and your rate is about 7.125%. At a one-point rate, meaning you gave your bank or mortgage company $5,000 in exchange for them reducing your interest rate, it takes the interest rate from 7.125% to 6.625%. The payment goes from $3,368 to $3,201, meaning a difference of $167 per month. When you do the math, you get your $5,000 back in about two and a half years.&nbsp;

Why you would or wouldn't do this depends on your thoughts about the future mortgage interest rate market. If you think we're at a point where mortgage interest rates are maybe as high as they're going to go, and in the near future, you're going to have the ability to refinance, you probably don't go all in on this mortgage interest rate buydown option. On the other hand, if you think rates are pretty good and may get higher in the coming months and years, then you would want to buy the interest rate down as much as possible as long as the math works because you're not going to have the opportunity to refinance in the coming months and years.
