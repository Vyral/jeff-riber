<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s an overview of why homeowners insurance costs are rising in FL.</em></p>

A couple of weeks ago, I was having a conversation with Danny Sands, owner of Brightway Insurance, who told me that homeowners insurance rates were about to go up. That was the first time I had heard such news, so it didn’t quite sink in then. Sure enough, though, I soon started seeing articles in real estate publications about the coming insurance rate climb, so I’ve invited Danny to chat publicly about the problem and discuss potential solutions for homeowners. Unfortunately, as Danny explains, it’s not just one issue affecting the homeowners insurance market here in Florida—it’s a multi-headed beast.&nbsp;

News of rising insurance costs is obviously a huge buzzkill, but what else would we expect from 2020 at this point? Let’s just be thankful for our properties and the coverage we do have, and take the necessary steps to guard ourselves against a market in flux. I hope you found this update from Danny helpful; if you want to hear more from him on this topic, **give him a ring at 904-999-3250.** As always, you can give me a call or send an email with any real estate-related concerns or questions. We look forward to hearing from you.
