If you’re a real estate investor, a 1031 exchange is a great way to avoid paying capital gains taxes while you build wealth over time. How does it work, though?&nbsp;

I've laid out a scenario explaining how 1031 exchanges work in today's video. Check out the timestamps below to browse various sections of this message at your leisure.

**1\. Your example scenario:**

* 0:46—You buy a house in 2011 for $100,000 and turn it into a rental in 2014 as you buy another house
* 1:32—You then decide to sell that house because it’s now worth $200,000
* 2:01—Accounting for rental property depreciation, you sell for a net gain of $120,000
* 3:06—Assuming you’re in a 25% long-term capital gains tax bracket, you’d pay $30,000 to the IRS after you sell

**2\. How the 1031 exchange works:**

* 4:04—An intermediary holds the proceeds from the sale
* 5:01—You then have 180 days to find a replacement property and buy it with those funds
* 5:50—Once you’re ready to close a deal, the intermediary releases the funds to complete the transaction
* 6:16—What you’d save in this scenario

So, if you have a rental property you’re thinking about selling, give me a call so we can talk more about the 1031 exchange. It’s a great way to build wealth over time and avoid paying huge tax fees every time you sell a property.&nbsp;
