I have some exciting news to share! After being with the same franchise since 2007, we are making a change and moving away from the franchise model to become an independent brokerage. The purpose and strategy behind this decision are to deliver more value to our clients and customers who are buying, selling, and having properties managed by us.

We will be launching a new website with updated home search tools and home valuation tools. Our property management systems and processes are being revamped. Additionally, we are improving our back-office software and the way we handle transactions for buyers and sellers. All of these changes are aimed at providing more value to you, our valued customers.

**On June 9, we will officially become Pursuit Real Estate,** and we couldn't be more thrilled about it. While a lot will remain the same, including our address and phone numbers, please note that my email address will be changing to [jeff@pursuitrealestate.com](mailto:jeff@pursuitrealestate.com). If you have any questions about this transition, I would be happy to discuss them with you.

I am incredibly excited about this new chapter, and please don't hesitate to call or email me. I am looking forward to continuing our work with you in the future.
