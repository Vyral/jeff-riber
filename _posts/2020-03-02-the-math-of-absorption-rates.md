Recently, I was analyzing what happened in 2019 in our real estate market. I was examining all the statistics, getting a feel for how 2019 went, and how it could impact 2020. I came up with a few essential facts that I felt you should know.&nbsp;

**The absorption rate, or inventory level, is the measure of how many homes we have for sale and how many we’re selling.** In 2019, the absorption rate ebbed and flowed between 3.8 and 3.2 months. To take this measurement for your neighborhood, you would want to look at the number of active listings in the past six months and how many homes were sold. For example, if there were 10 active listings and five houses were sold, you take 10 divided by five, which means we have two months of inventory.

Currently, we have 3.2 months of inventory, which means in about three months, all of our current listings will be sold. A few other factors come into play, but that is the basis for these figures. This low number is great for sellers but can be tough for buyers. As a buyer, this means a property might fetch multiple offers the first day it comes onto the market, and you’re competing with others.&nbsp;

The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is currently at 3.47%, which is going to fuel the market. As long as mortgage rates are that low and inventory is low, prices won’t slow down much.&nbsp;

I’m curious and excited to see what happens in 2020. **Many factors can change up these numbers, so we’ll see how our real estate market is affected** as we move through the year.

If you’re wondering what your home is worth, what you can get for the money as a buyer, or you just want to have a conversation about any of these statistics, feel free to call or email me. I would love to speak with you.
