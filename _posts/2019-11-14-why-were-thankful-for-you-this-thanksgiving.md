<p style="text-align: center;"><em>What are you thankful for this Thanksgiving? As you consider that question, let’s reflect on why gratitude is important to begin with.</em></p>

Though sharing what we’re grateful for can feel a little awkward at times, it’s an important practice nonetheless. And we at ERA Heavener Realty certainly aren’t ashamed to say that we’re thankful for you and all of your support this Thanksgiving, as well as all year round. In the words of famed American writer William Arthur Ward, “Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings.” So, once again, we want you to know that we appreciate you. We hope you and your loved ones get to spend plenty of time together over great food and great conversation this Turkey Day. Happy Thanksgiving\!
