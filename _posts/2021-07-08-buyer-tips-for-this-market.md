For as long as real estate has been bought and sold, sellers have wanted three things. They want the best price, the fewest number of headaches, and they want things on their schedule. As a buyer in a seller's market, here are some tips for how you can best construct an offer that gets the deal done.

Ideally, sellers want their highest-priced offer to be a cash offer. However, only 25% of transactions in our MLS over the past year have been cash deals.&nbsp;

If you're a buyer that's getting financing, how can you make your offer more attractive to a seller? You could waive your appraisal contingency or even add verbiage to the agreement that shows your willingness to cover an appraisal gap. This will reassure the seller that you are doing what you can to offer as few headaches as possible.

**The seller wants everything accomplished on their timeline.** They likely want to close on a particular date because of the stress and hassle of moving. Sellers appreciate you giving them a few days after closing to move.
