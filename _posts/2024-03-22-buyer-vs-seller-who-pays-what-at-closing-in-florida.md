Ever wondered who covers closing costs in real estate deals and why? While the "why" might not be straightforward, we can certainly shed some light on common practices.

Let’s focus on the landscape in Northeast Florida and how closing costs are typically divided between sellers and buyers. The adage “everything is negotiable” is certainly true in real estate. However, it is crucial to understand that there’s a customary distribution of costs.  So that you can negotiate effectively.

Traditionally, sellers are responsible for expenses related to transferring title. Some other typical costs covered by sellers are:

* Deed stamps
* Owner’s title insurance
* Title search
* Settlement fee
* Survey
* Prorated taxes
* Recording fees
* Real estate commissions (if applicable)
* Additional considerations for condos or rental properties with tenants.
* On the other hand, buyers usually bear the costs associated with financing like loans, which usually include the following:
* Note stamps
* Intangible tax
* Origination fees
* Credit report
* Appraisal
* Recording fees
* Homeowners association transfer fees
* Upfront mortgage insurance (if the down payment is less than 20%)

Having a general understanding for who pays what is helpful for both parties.  It will save you time, money, and stress by knowing which buttons to push during a negotiation.  For example, oftentimes the other party may be fixated on a particular price.  Therefore, they may be willing to pay for all, or at least a portion, of your closing costs. Knowing what's standard, and how much each item costs, will allow you to put a dollar figure on that tradeoff.
