closing costs and why. While the “why” might not have a straightforward answer, with years of experience and numerous transactions, I can provide some valuable insights into typical practices.

Let’s focus on the landscape in Northeast Florida and how closing costs are typically divided between sellers and buyers. The adage “everything is negotiable” holds true in real estate. However, it is crucial to understand that there’s a customary distribution of costs to negotiate effectively.

**Traditionally, sellers are responsible for expenses related to transferring titles.** Some other typical costs covered by sellers are:

* Deed stamps
* Owner's title insurance
* Title search
* Settlement fee
* Survey
* Prorated taxes
* Recording fees
* Real estate commissions (if applicable)
* Additional considerations for condos or rental properties with tenants.

**On the other hand, buyers usually bear the costs associated with financing like loans, which usually include the following:**

* Note stamps and tangible tax
* Origination fees
* Credit report
* Appraisal
* Recording fees
* Homeowners association fees
* Mortgage insurance (if the down payment is less than 20%).

Understanding these cost allocations is useful for both parties involved in a real estate transaction. Whether you are a seller aiming to negotiate effectively or a buyer seeking clarity on financial obligations, knowing who pays for what sets the stage for informed decision-making.
