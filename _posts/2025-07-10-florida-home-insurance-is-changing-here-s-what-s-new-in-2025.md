**The Florida insurance market is finally softening after years of volatility.** In a recent video conversation with Danny Sands of Brightway Insurance, we broke down what these changes mean for homeowners—and how to take advantage of them.

**What’s Changed in 2025?**

Thanks to new legislation that cracks down on roofing contractor fraud and “assignment of benefits” abuse, Florida’s insurance market is shifting from a hard market to a softer one. That means **more competition and potentially better pricing**, although Danny warns that some introductory offers may be short-lived.

**Tips to Lower Your Insurance Premium**

If your home was built **before 2002**, getting a **wind mitigation inspection** could unlock significant savings. This inspection looks at how your roof is built and how well it can withstand storms.

Other smart moves:

* **Review your personal property limits** (you might be over-insured)
* **Consider increasing your deductible** if you have emergency savings

**Buying an Older Home? Know This.**

Older homes come with a few extra considerations:

* The **age of the roof** is a big deal. Insurers prefer roofs under 15 years old.
* **A newer water heater** can help reduce premiums and prevent issues down the line.
* Remember: Insurance doesn’t cover **maintenance or wear and tear**—budget accordingly.

**The Deductible Breakdown**

Not all deductibles are created equal. Here are the three types you’ll see:

* **All Other Perils (AOP)** – Covers most non-storm claims.
* **Hurricane Deductible** – Usually a percentage of your dwelling coverage.
* **Wind/Hail Deductible** – A newer option, also often percentage-based.

Choosing a low premium plan with a **high wind/hail deductible** can backfire if you face storm damage. Always read the fine print.
