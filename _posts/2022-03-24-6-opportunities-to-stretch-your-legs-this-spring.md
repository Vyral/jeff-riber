Walking is a great way to take advantage of the weather and to connect with nature, and luckily for you, there are some great walking trails in the Jacksonville area. Today I’ll introduce you to six of my favorite trails:

**1\.**&nbsp;[**Mickler’s Landing.**](https://www.floridashistoriccoast.com/beaches/micklers-landing/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} This is a great place to spend a warm spring day, but try to come on an off day if you want to avoid a crowd. If you’re into hunting for shark’s teeth, this is the place to go.

**2\.**&nbsp;[**UNF Trails.**](https://www.unf.edu/recwell/ecoadventure/Trails/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}&nbsp;Right at 295 in the St. John’s Town Center Parkway, you’ll find the entrance to the UNF trails. Each trail is a different distance and marks a pathway through different areas that are worth seeing. Whether you want to do a lap around the lake, go on a leisurely walk through woods, or take a stroll along the boardwalk, the UNF trails are a great opportunity to mix it up.

**3\.**&nbsp;[**Timucuan Preserve.**](https://www.nps.gov/timu/index.htm){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} Here, you can find a trail that takes you out toward the river before opening up to a wider space. Beyond a gorgeous hike through the woods, you can also wander the past in their historic museums.

**4\.&nbsp;**[**Tree Hill Nature Center.**](https://www.treehill.org/visit/trails){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} Each of the seven trails at the Nature Center has a different distance, difficulty level, and landscape, meaning you can choose one based on your preferences.

**5\.**&nbsp;[**The Jacksonville Bridges.**](https://www.visitjacksonville.com/blog/city-of-bridges/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}&nbsp;This collection of nine bridges crisscrosses through the city, and each has its own unique history. From beaches to boulevards, these bridges are phenomenal routes to walk. Elevation is somewhat hard to come by here in Jacksonville, so these bridges are also a good way to train for an upcoming marathon.

**6\. [The Deerwood Neighborhood.](http://jeffreyriber-eraheavenerrealty.sites.erarealestate.com/search/#status=active&amp;sold_days=180&amp;pstatus=1%2C11&amp;ls_conversion=acres&amp;location_search_field=Deerwood%2C%20Jacksonville%2C%20FL%2C%20USA&amp;drive_time=09%3A00&amp;drive_duration=15&amp;drive_avoid_ferry=1&amp;drive_departure=1&amp;ss_description=Deerwood%2C%20Jacksonville%2C%20FL%2032256&amp;ss_email_freq=40&amp;ss_send_zero_result=1&amp;bounds_north=30.250245774488683&amp;bounds_east=-81.51471500703794&amp;bounds_south=30.200928038279056&amp;bounds_west=-81.56003361055356&amp;center_lat=30.2412966&amp;center_lon=-81.5303821&amp;center_lat_pan=30.225589997910827&amp;center_lon_pan=-81.53737430879575&amp;geotype=CUSTOM&amp;user_lat=30.2412966&amp;user_lon=-81.5303821&amp;pgsize=20&amp;startidx=0&amp;zoom=14&amp;user_uuid=8b24c2b7-e6f1-4d57-bb22-12d381133038&amp;sort_by=1&amp;company_uuid=3986599&amp;commute=0&amp;geolayer=%7B%22custom%22%3Atrue%2C%22geojson%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22MultiPolygon%22%2C%22coordinates%22%3A%5B%5B%5B%5B-81.55222301790218%2C30.21976810774834%5D%2C%5B-81.55222301790218%2C30.219842274121234%5D%2C%5B-81.5521371872137%2C30.230150855810432%5D%2C%5B-81.55205135652523%2C30.232375587776687%5D%2C%5B-81.5517938644598%2C30.233413778799967%5D%2C%5B-81.55170803377132%2C30.233562090908336%5D%2C%5B-81.55162220308284%2C30.23371040279297%5D%2C%5B-81.55093555757503%2C30.234451958859932%5D%2C%5B-81.54981975862484%2C30.235267664072914%5D%2C%5B-81.54964809724788%2C30.235341818756655%5D%2C%5B-81.54947643587093%2C30.235415973384452%5D%2C%5B-81.54913311311702%2C30.235490127956314%5D%2C%5B-81.5466440231512%2C30.236009208393096%5D%2C%5B-81.5426099807928%2C30.236305824554904%5D%2C%5B-81.54183750459651%2C30.236305824554904%5D%2C%5B-81.53840427705745%2C30.236083362517448%5D%2C%5B-81.5353143722723%2C30.235786745684383%5D%2C%5B-81.53488521882991%2C30.235712591336277%5D%2C%5B-81.53359775850276%2C30.235490127956314%5D%2C%5B-81.52801876375179%2C30.23430364809404%5D%2C%5B-81.52776127168636%2C30.234229492627165%5D%2C%5B-81.52750377962093%2C30.23415533710439%5D%2C%5B-81.5272462875555%2C30.234081181525664%5D%2C%5B-81.5269029648016%2C30.233858714453838%5D%2C%5B-81.52655964204769%2C30.23363624687863%5D%2C%5B-81.52647381135921%2C30.233562090908336%5D%2C%5B-81.52638798067073%2C30.23348793488214%5D%2C%5B-81.52630214998226%2C30.233413778799967%5D%2C%5B-81.52407055208187%2C30.230966596709695%5D%2C%5B-81.52389889070491%2C30.23074412259017%5D%2C%5B-81.52364139863948%2C30.230373331272325%5D%2C%5B-81.52355556795101%2C30.23022501435364%5D%2C%5B-81.52346973726253%2C30.230076697211246%5D%2C%5B-81.52338390657405%2C30.22985422107818%5D%2C%5B-81.52329807588558%2C30.229557585451015%5D%2C%5B-81.52312641450862%2C30.22889015201796%5D%2C%5B-81.52269726106624%2C30.22696198554102%5D%2C%5B-81.52261143037776%2C30.226442857337428%5D%2C%5B-81.52252559968929%2C30.22592372639341%5D%2C%5B-81.52252559968929%2C30.216727238313428%5D%2C%5B-81.52269726106624%2C30.216356394146903%5D%2C%5B-81.52278309175472%2C30.216208056088874%5D%2C%5B-81.52329807588558%2C30.215466362443788%5D%2C%5B-81.52364139863948%2C30.21539219277174%5D%2C%5B-81.52492885896663%2C30.215243853259896%5D%2C%5B-81.53093700715999%2C30.214873003501772%5D%2C%5B-81.53342609712581%2C30.214873003501772%5D%2C%5B-81.54012089082698%2C30.214947173565236%5D%2C%5B-81.55127888032894%2C30.218136433397103%5D%2C%5B-81.55222301790218%2C30.21976810774834%5D%2C%5B-81.55222301790218%2C30.21976810774834%5D%5D%5D%5D%7D%2C%22geolayerid%22%3A-1%2C%22templateids%22%3A%5B%5D%7D&amp;buffer_miles=0.25&amp;geospatial=true&amp;ptype=1%2C2&amp;searchType=criteria&amp;omit_hidden=true&amp;ex_pend=true){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** This is the neighborhood where my family lives, so I might be biased, but it’s a great place to walk if you enjoy the atmosphere of old oak trees, magnolias, birds, and beautiful homes. You do have to live here in order to walk around on a regular basis, but lucky for you, there are homes for sale in the area.
