Today I’m speaking with a great guest, Paul Anderson of MovingtoFloridaGuide.com. There’s been a ton of migration to Florida recently, so I figured I’d bring in an expert on the topic. Paul has tons of experience helping people move to Florida, so I’ll pick his brain about why he started doing what he does, the current state of migration, and what it all means for the future of our state.&nbsp;
