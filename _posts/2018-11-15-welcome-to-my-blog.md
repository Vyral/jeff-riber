Our market remains busy, and it's still an opportune time to command a high price selling your home. &nbsp;

I know what’s happening in Jacksonville, specifically pertaining to home values, that will directly affect you.

So, I’ll be posting two monthly video messages on this blog to keep you updated.&nbsp;

They will be valuable and useful in helping you stay on top of what’s happening in the community.

You can also search all homes for sale on the Jacksonville MLS on our website at [ERAHeavenerRealty.com](https://www.era.com/era-heavener-realty--2407c).&nbsp;

You can save properties to view, schedule showings for a home, and more.&nbsp;

Let me know if you have any questions or if you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in Jacksonville soon.

Check back because content will be coming soon!

I’m excited to keep you updated on what’s going on with Jacksonville real estate.&nbsp;
