I’m going to stray a little from real estate today to talk about one of my favorite things in the workplace: standing desks.&nbsp;

How many of you use a standing desk on a daily or weekly basis? **I’ve been using one for about eight years now and I absolutely love it.** It’s a habit at this point and something I don’t talk about as much as I used to. &nbsp;But let's take a minute to to discuss a few of the benefits. &nbsp;

You can increase your energy level, burn more calories, and even reduce soreness after your morning exercise routine. **Not to mention a marked difference in your posture** (if your conscious about it).

I’ve seen some anti-standing desk studies and here are my thoughts on that: If you stand in the same exact spot for three hours straight, obviously that’s not good for you. **&nbsp;You need to move around throughout the day.** Put a pull-up bar, a balance board, or some kettle-bells in your office. &nbsp;Take a seat when you're tired. &nbsp;Just don't be stationary all day long\!

If you’re considering a standing desk, here are a few brands you should take a look at:

* **Geekdesk.** It’s a little pricey, but it’s motorized, it works great, and I’ve had one since 2012.
* **Varidesk.** You can use one of these to raise and lower your existing desk.&nbsp;

I hope this has been helpful to you. If you have any questions for me about standing desks or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
