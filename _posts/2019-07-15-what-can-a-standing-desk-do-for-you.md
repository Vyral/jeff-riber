We’re not talking about anything explicitly real estate-related today, but we are talking about something else that I’m passionate about: Standing desks.

How many of you use a standing desk on a daily or weekly basis? **I’ve been using one for about eight years now and I absolutely love it.** It’s a habit at this point and something I don’t talk about as much as I used to, but I thought I would talk about it today in order to discuss all the benefits it has given me.<br>&nbsp;<br>My standing desk has not only increased my energy level, but it has also kept me from getting sore after exercise as well. **You also have better posture, burn more calories, and more.**

I’ve seen some anti-standing desk studies and here are my thoughts on that: If you stand in the same exact spot for three hours straight, obviously that’s not good for you because **you need to move around every so often.** Put a pull-up bar or some dumbbells in your office so you can take a break every hour or so, move around, and get back to work.

If you’re considering a standing desk, here are a few brands you should look at more closely:

* **Geekdesk**. It’s a little pricey, but it’s motorized, it works great, and I’ve had one since 2012.
* **Varidesk**. You can use one of these to raise and lower your existing desk.&nbsp;

I hope this has been helpful to you. If you have any questions for me about standing desks or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
