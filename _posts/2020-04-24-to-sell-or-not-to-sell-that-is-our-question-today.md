Here's the scenario. &nbsp;You're thinking about making a move, but can't decide if you should sell your existing home or rent it out. &nbsp;Assuming you're financially capable of moving without selling, which should you do?

Today I’ll discuss the pros and cons of each, and give you some insight that will help you make the best possible decision.

We will set up a scenario in the video that is very realistic. &nbsp;Obviously, it won't match your situation exactly. &nbsp;If you would like for me to run the numbers on your particular plan, just give me a call\!

**Feel free to follow along in the video above or use the timestamps I’ve provided below to navigate the discussion at your leisure:**
