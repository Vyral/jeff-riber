<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s a quick message of gratitude as we approach Thanksgiving.</em></p>

It’s once again that season where we take time to pause and reflect on what we’re grateful for, which is especially important in this turbulent year. &nbsp;First, I want to say thank you for all of your support for our team; we wouldn’t be where we are today without you. I also wanted to share a quote with you from G.K. Chesterton: “When it comes to life, the critical thing is whether you take things for granted or take them with gratitude.” No matter what comes our way, we can still find ways to be thankful, and I wanted to pass that along to you this holiday season. To hear my full Thanksgiving message, watch the short video above.
