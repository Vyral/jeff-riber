<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s a quick breakdown of how real estate agents get paid.</em></p>

How do real estate agents get paid?

To answer that question, let’s first address who pays a real estate agent. **Roughly 99% of the time, it’s the seller.** In fact, in my 12 years as an agent, I can’t ever remember a transaction where the buyer paid an agent’s commission. This doesn’t mean it never takes place, but it’s not customary in our Northeast Florida market.&nbsp;

There are two portions of each commission the seller pays: the portion that goes to their listing agent and the portion that’s offered to any buyers’ agents in the area so that they bring in interested buyers.&nbsp;

All agents and brokerages have to abide by the Sherman Antitrust Act, which is intended to prevent price-fixing. In other words, it’s illegal for one real estate company to go to another company and establish an average commission rate for a transaction. If you ask an agent what the average commission is and they’re finicky about answering, that’s why. **There is no such thing as an “average” commission.** Each brokerage sets their own commission rate, and they’re always negotiable.&nbsp;

It’s also important to note that **agents don’t get paid directly.** The commission the seller pays goes straight to the agents’ brokerages because they’re the only ones who can legally receive compensation for their services. After they receive the commission, they then split it with their agent. This is another thing that’s negotiable—different companies offer different splits for their agents. &nbsp;

Finally, **since not all agents are created equal, they’re paid on a cost-versus-value basis.** For example, Gardner Minshew II, the Jacksonville Jaguars’ starting quarterback, will make about $700,000 this year. That’s a lot of money, and he ranks 12th in terms of quarterback rating—one slot behind Tom Brady, but way ahead of Jared Goff of the Los Angeles Rams, who ranks 27th but stands to earn $26 million this year. Basically, the Jaguars are paying Minshew 37x less than what the Rams are paying Goff.&nbsp;

That is to say, there’s a difference between what you pay and the value you receive. To find out what value an agent brings to the table, research their experience and performance history: how many homes they sell per year, how their sale price compares to each home’s list price, what their average days on market is, etc.&nbsp;
