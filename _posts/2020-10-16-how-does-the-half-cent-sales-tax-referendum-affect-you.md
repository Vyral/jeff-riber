What do you need to know about the upcoming half-cent sales tax referendum? Today I’m joined by Shannon Beckham, a former teacher and mother of two children enrolled in the Duval County public school system, to answer that question. I had questions myself about this referendum, and I was directed to Shannon through a mutual friend. She has no dog in this fight, and she’s as well-informed about the issue as anyone.&nbsp;
