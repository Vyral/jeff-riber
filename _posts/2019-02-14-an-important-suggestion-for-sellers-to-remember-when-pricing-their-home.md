**All square footage is not equal square footage**—this is a crucial detail that is sometimes lost on home sellers who are deciding what price point their property should be in and what a potential buyer would be willing to pay.

When trying to come up with a reasonable price per square inch on your property, the price your neighbor sold their property may not be indicative of your home’s value. **Factors like the lot the seller is in, any renovations made on the home, and the nature of the square footage all have to be taken into account.**

If an enclosed screen porch or garage makes up a fairly large share of your home’s square footage, it’s probably not going to be worth as much to a buyer as an “open-air” room like a larger bedroom, kitchen, or bathroom.

And while online home valuation tools like Zillow are useful in giving you a broader view of what homes are selling for in your area, they’re less dependable when you need to be strategic with pricing your home based on the particulars and unique aspects of your situation.
