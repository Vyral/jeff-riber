**All square footage is not equal**—this is a crucial detail that is sometimes lost on us as we try to decipher how another home compares to our own. &nbsp;Strategically pricing your home depends on making savvy decision around this idea. &nbsp;

When trying to come up with a reasonable price per square foot on your property, the price your neighbor sold for may not necessarily be "apples to apples." **Factors like the lot itself, any renovations made on the home, and the nature of the square footage all have to be taken into account.**

Let's say you enclosed a garage to make a bonus room. &nbsp;The additional square footage should not be treated the same as that of a larger home with a floor plan that's more functional. &nbsp;Intuitively we know this, but practically we like to forget it when it applies to ourselves.

Online home valuation tools like [Zillow](https://www.904living.com/buying/online-tools/zillow-valuation-fact-or-fiction/){: target="_blank"} are useful in giving a broad view of what homes are selling for in your area. &nbsp;They’re less dependable when you need to be strategic with pricing your home based on the particulars and unique aspects of your situation.
