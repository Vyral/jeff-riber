Today I’m announcing my new website for buyers and sellers in Jacksonville, Florida: [FindHomesJacksonville.com](https://www.findhomesjacksonville.com/). In the last 15 years of working in real estate, I noticed that buyers flock to websites like Zillow because they’re user-friendly. These sites are simple, easy to use, and get you the information you want. However, when you actually want to do something on that site, you have to deal with inaccurate data and get hounded by dozens of real estate agents because the site is selling your data.&nbsp;

For almost a year now, I’ve been trying to find a site that doesn’t have these problems. I couldn’t find such a site, so I created one myself. With my new site, the data is phenomenal, and you’ll never get hassled by agents. I’m the only one who can see your information, and while I want to help you when the time is right, I don’t want to bother you when it’s not.

**My site has a great advanced search feature where you can filter by almost anything.** You can look for sold properties, search by MLS numbers, enter an address and find if it’s ever been sold, run a foreclosure search, sort by the type of property you want, and more. There’s even a map feature where you can draw an area you’d like to search for homes directly on a map of Jacksonville. You can also sort by a neighborhood you’re interested in or filter by cities and subdivisions.

The home search is pretty impressive, but there’s also another feature on my site. **If you click on the “Home Worth” tab, it will take you to a simple online home valuation based on recent comparable sales.** All you have to do is give it your email, and it will send the info to you. However, it’s still just a computer algorithm, so if you’d like a more detailed valuation of your property, call or email me.

I’d also love your feedback on what else you’d like to see on the site. It’s still early on, and I’m constantly making improvements, so I’d love to hear what you think about it. If you have any questions or suggestions for the site, call me at (904) 405-1995. I’d love to hear from you.
