Merry Christmas to you and your family\! Around this time of year, there are a couple of things my family loves to do around Jacksonville. Here are just a few:

**1\. Live Nativity.** This takes place at a church in Northeast Florida every year, but the specific location is different each time, so you’ll need to do a little research.

**2\. Deck the chairs.** This event takes place at Jacksonville Beach, and it’s always a ton of fun.&nbsp;

**3\. Lights at Blackhawks Buff.** This is a neighborhood in East Arlington famous for its amazing lights. Try not to go on a weekend or too close to Christmas because it will be packed.&nbsp;

**4\. Night of lights.** This is another light extravaganza that takes place in St. Augustine.&nbsp;
