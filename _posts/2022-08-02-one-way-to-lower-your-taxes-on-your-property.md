Who likes paying more taxes than they’re supposed to? I think the answer would be no one\! That is why I want to bring up an often-overlooked strategy when buying, renting, or selling real estate that might help you reduce your taxes.&nbsp;

The Self-Directed Individual Retirement Account (SDIRA) is a great tool for building wealth. Remember that I am not a CPA or an attorney, so this isn’t tax or legal advice. However, I can tell you that you have to pay taxes on what you report to the IRS as your net rental income, and there is a tax on your long-term capital gains. In many instances, people give up around 5.5% of that income to the IRS, which isn’t fun\! **However, the SDIRA allows you to avoid portions of that tax when you rent or sell.**&nbsp;

In its most simple form, you would buy the property in the name of the SDIRA, then all rents and expenses would go under its umbrella. Just like any other retirement account, there are rules and guidelines, and you won’t be able to take the money out right away. When you sell the property, the money has to stay in the account until you are of age. **Still, the point is to build wealth for the future.**&nbsp;

I wanted to explain this concept because I got into SDIRAs this year—my first investment property is in one\! If you have any questions about how to make it happen, I’m here to help. Call or email me, I’d love to hear from you\!
