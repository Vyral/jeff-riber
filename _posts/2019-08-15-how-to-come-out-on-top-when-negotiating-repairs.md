Whether you’re currently in the middle of buying or selling a home or don’t have plans to do so for quite some time, this message is one you’ll definitely want to check out—it could help save you a lot of time, money, and hassle.&nbsp;

Today, we’ll be discussing everything you need to know about how to win when negotiating repairs.&nbsp;

Did you know that repair-related disagreements are the second most common reason real estate deals fall apart? It’s true. Thankfully, by following just a few simple tips, you can make sure that your repair negotiations go smoothly and successfully.

Here are our top three tips:&nbsp;

**1\. Take your emotions out of the equation.** While buying and selling real estate can be very emotional experiences, it’s important to remain objective and level-headed when you talk about repairs. If, for example, you’re selling your home and a buyer complains about a detail of your home that you don’t see an issue with, try to remove your personal bias and see things from their perspective. You don’t necessarily have to resolve the problem, but you should at least consider it.&nbsp;

**2\. Get everything in writing.** Our Northeast Florida Association of Realtors’ Purchase Agreement states that all work will be completed by appropriately licensed individuals. If a seller agrees to repair something upon a buyer’s request, the two of them should always sign an agreement indicating that the seller won’t just attempt to make this repair on their own. Even if the seller has the necessary knowledge to complete the repairs, they aren’t authorized to do so unless they have the proper license. Putting all agreements into writing will help both parties avoid unpleasant surprises when closing day arrives.&nbsp;

**3\. Resolve repair requests through credit rather than by ordering repairs.** Often, having the seller offer the buyer a financial credit is a better option than trying to orchestrate repairs prior to closing. Alternatively, the seller may adjust the purchase price to compensate for the amount the buyer will have to spend on repairs.&nbsp;
