In today’s video, I sat down to have a conversation with Rich Brooks, the founder of the St. Augustine Law Group, about entity structure for buying investment properties in a hot real estate market. I’ve done business with them before and had such a great experience that I thought it would be a good idea to let you all benefit from Rich’s expertise as well. If you or someone you know is thinking of buying investment properties, this is valuable information to have.
