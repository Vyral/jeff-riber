What’s happening in our Northeast Florida real estate market as we head into the summer season? Today I have the latest statistics to share with you. First, we’ll look at mortgage interest rates and showing activity, then we’ll check the median sale price and supply and demand statistics. Finally, we’ll go over the statewide unemployment numbers.
