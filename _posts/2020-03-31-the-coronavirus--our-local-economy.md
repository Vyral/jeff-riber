<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Local business owner Ansley Randall joins me today to discuss the impact the coronavirus has had on our Jacksonville economy.</em></p>

Today I’m joined by Ansley Randall—graphic designer, artist, and owner of Jax Is Rad—to talk a little about her design business and how the coronavirus has impacted the Jacksonville economy. Now more than ever, it’s important to support local businesses, and Ansley has her ear to the ground in terms of how you can support those in our community who could use a helping hand.
