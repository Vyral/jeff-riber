If you’re looking to move into a new home, should you simply sell your current home on the market and use the proceeds to buy a new one, or should you rent out your home and use it as an investment? Today I’ll discuss the pros and cons of each option and give you some insight that will help you make a decision about the best path forward.

Here’s an example scenario I’ll use to highlight my points: You bought a house in 2013 for $150,000 and borrowed $144,750 with an FHA loan.
