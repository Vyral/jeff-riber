Today we’re taking a step back from hardcore business information to talk about something a little different. Matt Miller, ERA’s property manager, and Zach Corson, the transaction manager, join me to talk about quarantine movies.&nbsp;

If you ever do business with us, you’ll probably cross paths with one of these two, but instead of picking their brains for expertise about real estate transactions, I wanted to talk about their favorite movies to help get them through these tough times.

**Here are each of their top three favorite movies to rewatch during quarantine:**

**Matt:**

1. Caddyshack
2. Happy Gilmore
3. Major League II

**Zach:**

1. Star Wars
2. Lord of the Rings
3. The Dark Knight

**My own picks:**

1. Man on Fire
2. Inception
3. &iexcl;Three Amigos\!

If you’re in need of a way to keep yourself entertained, check out our top movie picks\! Hopefully they’ll help brighten your week as things start to return to normal.

In the meantime, if you have any questions about real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’re here to help you.
