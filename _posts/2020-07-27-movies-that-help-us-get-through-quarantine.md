Today we’re taking a step back from hardcore business information to talk about something a little different. Matt Miller ERA’s property manager, and Zach Corson, the transaction manager, join me to talk about quarantine movies. If you ever do business with us, you’ll probably cross paths with one of these two, but instead of picking their brains for expertise about real estate transactions, I wanted to talk about their favorite movies to help get them through these tough times. To hear about their favorite movies and which ones they’d recommend, watch our latest video above.
