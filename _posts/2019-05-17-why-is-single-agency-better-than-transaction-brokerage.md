If and when you go to buy or sell a house, **the distinction between hiring a single agent versus hiring a transaction broker has huge ripple effects that can make or break your deal.&nbsp;**

The best way to explain transaction brokerage is that the agent is there to help put a deal together, but they technically don’t represent you. That's where people get confused. They might not exactly have your best interest in mind. **This is because transaction brokerage relationships lack these four things: loyalty, confidentiality, obedience, and full disclosure.** On the other hand, all of these things are present with single agency.

How can you get the best deal for you and your family if you’re working with someone who doesn’t give you loyalty, confidentiality, obedience, and full disclosure? The answer is that you can’t.&nbsp;

**This is an issue that just doesn’t get enough attention so I wanted to bring it to yours today.** The next time you are hiring a real estate agent, single agency is obviously the right way to go.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me in the meantime about single agency, the market, or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
