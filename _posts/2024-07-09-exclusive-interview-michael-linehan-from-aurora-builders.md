We  had the pleasure of interviewing Michael Lenahen from Aurora Builders. We’re excited to share his work with you. Michael is a renowned local custom builder in Northeast Florida, known for his exceptional work. I must admit, I found myself secretly jealous as I browsed through the stunning custom homes they've built, dreaming that one day, I'll be calling Michael to build a house for me.
