Ready for a break from the usual real estate hustle? Let’s talk about something everyone can agree on—ice cream. That’s right, I’m serving up the Top 5 Favorite Ice Cream Stops in Northeast Florida, counting down from five to one. Whether you’re a local craving a treat or a visitor searching for the perfect scoop, these spots are guaranteed to hit the sweet spot:

**\#5: Gator Ice Cream.** It’s the only spot I haven’t personally visited on this list. I’ve heard great things from friends, and it has tons of positive reviews online. I wanted to include a place with a different location and vibe, so I chose Gator Ice Cream out at the beach.

**\#4: Milkster.** This spot is all about the nitrogen ice cream experience. You start by choosing a base and your toppings, and then they use a fancy nitrogen process to whip up your custom ice cream creation. I don’t have a specific favorite flavor here because there are so many options to create your own, but it’s definitely worth the visit.

**\#3: 5FX Ice Cream**. It is located at Southside and Baymeadows Road. This place has a similar interactive vibe to Milkster, but here, the staff prepares your ice cream in front of you on a steel frozen board. The milk freezes while they mix in your chosen toppings, creating a unique and entertaining experience. Again, I don’t have a go-to flavor because there are countless combinations to try, so feel free to experiment and find your favorite!

**\#2: Jeremiah’s Italian Ice.** This spot is known more for its Italian ice, but it also has some excellent ice cream combos. My top recommendation here is the Peanut Butter Cup—a pre-made combo that mixes ice cream (or gelato, as they call it) with Italian ice. It’s delicious. They have several locations throughout Northeast Florida, including San Jose, Beaches, Mandarin, and the Town Center.

**\#1: Mayday Ice Cream.** This is the place where I grab a carton to go and stash it in the garage freezer before my kids find out. Mayday has several locations around town, so check Google Maps to see which one is closest to you. While there are plenty of great flavors, my top pick for the adults is Parent Trap. It’s hands down my favorite, but there are lots of other tasty options for everyone in the family.

Whether you’re looking for a beachside treat, a hands-on ice cream adventure, or a classic scoop of Italian ice, these spots offer something for every sweet tooth. So why not take a break from the everyday grind, explore the area, and indulge in a little frozen delight? After all, life is too short to skip dessert! Next time you find yourself in Northeast Florida, swing by one of these places and treat yourself to a scoop (or two).
