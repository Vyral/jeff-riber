If you own real estate in the state of Florida, I have something important to share with you that might save you some money and will certainly save you a lot of headaches and hassle. This is about property fraud alerts. [Duval County](https://www.duvalclerk.com/services/property-fraud-alert), [Saint John's County](https://stjohnsclerk.com/protect-yourself-from-property-fraud-with-free-alerts-through-the-st-johns-county-clerk-of-courts/), and [Clay County](https://clayclerk.com/online-options/trishield-fraud-alert/) all offer this service, and the rest of the counties in Florida probably do the same.&nbsp;

**The service monitors the official records website for any transfers or legal instruments that are recorded against the property that you own.** When something gets recorded, whether it's a deed or a notice of commencement or mortgage, they notify you. That way, if you didn’t make the change, you can know it's probably a fraud and you should check into it.

I use this service, and the other day I got notifications about a house I was selling personally. It caught the notice of commencement for a roof and another permit we had pulled. Therefore, I know this service works.

You may be wondering why anyone would record a fake deed or a fake anything else against a property. To answer that, you should know that there are scammers out there who record a deed to themselves and then pretend to be the owner, rent the property out and collect the rent on a vacant house. There are others out there who will get all of your Social Security legal information and then pretend to be you and try to refinance or get a mortgage against your house. Those are the types of things we all want to avoid.&nbsp;

How do you get signed up for this service? **It’s very simple.**Just click on one of the links above, scroll down to the property fraud alerts part, agree to the terms of service, and input your name and either an email address or phone number. Then you will be signed up for alerts.&nbsp;

I recommend you take the time to do this. It will take you 30 seconds and could save you 30 hours' worth of hassle down the road if something were to happen. Call or email me if you have any questions.
