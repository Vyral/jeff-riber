  Hey, I'm Jeff. Good to meet you!


  Officially, I got my real estate license in 2007.  But the passion for real
  estate began well before that.  My Dad (and my Mom, Uncle, Granddad, Cousins,
  Sister...) was in the real estate business.  I can remember going to his
  office as a kid.  Right around the time the MLS was converting from a paper
  handbook to an online database.  And being fascinated by the idea of being
  able to see, online, listings of homes that were for sale.  I was around 11 or
  12 at the time, and can now look back to realize that was the initial spark.  


  Fast forward.  I actually began my journey as a real estate agent in 2007
  (yes, just before the "great recession") after working in the mortgage
  business for a few years. In 2011, I took on the role of broker/owner at ERA
  Heavener Realty. Then in 2023 we opened an independent brokerage, Pursuit Real
  Estate.


  Throughout my career, I have brokered over a thousand transactions and
  personally bought and sold more than 80 homes. Some years back, I was
  privileged to be nominated to the Jacksonville Business Journal's 40 Under 40
  (although 40 is clearly in the rear-view now!).


  It wasn't always easy.  I'm sure you'd say the same for accomplishments that
  have taken you years/decades?  But, thankfully, we've built a team and
  established processes capable of delivering at a high-level for the clients we
  serve.  


  Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President, has this quote that I love: "Every
  person who invests in well-selected real estate in a growing section of a
  prosperous community adopts the surest and safest method of becoming
  independent, for real estate is the basis of wealth."  We live in a place
  (northeast Florida) and time when this still holds true!  If your goal is to
  improve your well-being and that of your family, home-ownership is undoubtedly
  the way to go.


  Beyond my professional pursuits, I love traveling alongside my wife to fun and
  exciting places (though the destinations have become less fascinating as we
  have more kids.  I.E. Disney).  Additionally, spending quality time with our
  crew, Anniston, Miles, Ava, Lily, and Leighton, keeps me on my toes. And,
  despite losing a step or two, I still love playing basketball.


  Feel free to reach out, would love to hear about what you'd like to accomplish
  in real estate!
