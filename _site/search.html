  <title>Jacksonville Real Estate Video Blog with Jeff Riber</title>
  <meta name="description" content="You're probably looking for someone to help you make a good decision on your next real estate transaction, yes? Theodore Roosevelt (our 26th President) has this quote that I love, “Every person who invests in well-selected real estate in a growing section of a prosperous community adopts the surest and safest method of becoming independent, for real estate is the basis of wealth.” If your aim is to improve your well being, and the well being of your family, then home-ownership is a great way (if not the best way) to do it!

We know that good decisions are made with good information. Just like many other categories of our economy, residential real estate has become a very specialized skill. Making sure that you have a skilled professional alongside you when buying or selling is critical. Mistakes can be costly.

I grew up in Jacksonville (minus 4 years in Virginia getting a degree in Finance from Liberty University) and love almost everything about the real estate business. I have a tendency to try and do things that people tell me I shouldn't. Thus, jumping into the real estate business during the "Great Recession" was a pretty predictable move. I've been working as a real estate agent since 2007 (prior to that I was in the mortgage business) and became the broker/owner of ERA Heavener Realty in 2011. At this point, I'm well past 400 closings in my career, and have personally bought/sold over 50 homes. In 2010 I was honored to have been nominated to the Jacksonville Business Journals 40 Under 40 crew. All of that to say, I've taken all of the bumps and bruises the real estate market has to offer, so that I can help you avoid them :)

In addition to real estate, I love traveling with my wife to cool places, hanging out with our little ones (Anniston, Miles, Ava, Lily, and Leighton),  and playing basketball (even though I have lost a step... Or, two).

        "content": "Here are my top five picks for must-have smart home technologies.Today I want to share five smart home devices that I think you’d love to have as an addition to your home. Whether you’re thinking of buying a home and want to know what to install or you’ve been in your house for years and just want to improve your experience, here are my top five recommendations:1. Nest thermostat. There are other brands of smart thermostats, but Nest has been my favorite. It’s user-friendly and does what you need it to without giving you a ton of confusing and unnecessary options. It has the capacity to change the temperature of your home when you’re gone and lets you change settings while you’re sitting in bed at night. Even better, it’s not much more expensive than your average thermostat.2. The myQ garage opener. The Chamberlain myQ remote garage door opening system operates from an app on your phone that allows you to do all sorts of things. For example, you can open the garage door for a repairman to fix something while you’re away or when you lose your keys. It also alerts you when you’ve left your garage door open, so it’s great for those who have a penchant for forgetting things like that.“Installing smart technology could add value to your home.”3. Rachio sprinkler system. This is a phenomenal product that I’ve had on our current house for over six years now. It’s as simple as installing it where your normal sprinkler controller box would be and downloading an app on your phone. It allows you to set a schedule to run the sprinklers, and it even checks the weather every day to allow you to schedule your sprinklers accordingly. No more relying on inaccurate rain gauges in the yard!4. Ring doorbell and floodlights. Many people have a video doorbell these days. The Ring is my favorite; their app is great, and they also have a motion-detection floodlight system I enjoy. When something triggers the motion sensor, the floodlights come on, and the camera begins recording. That allows you to keep an eye on things while you’re away and record certain funny moments.5. Magic Light Wi-Fi bulbs. We put these in the lamps around the house. As long as you have a Wi-Fi connection, you’re able to control when the lights come on from your phone. The app allows you to change the brightness and color of the bulb, and you can sync the lights to music.If you have any questions or would like further recommendations for smart home technology, don’t hesitate to reach out to us by phone or email.

        "content": "Here’s what you need to know about CDD fees and how they’re paid.What are CDD fees? How do they get paid? How should we think about them? Today I’ll answer all three of these questions for you.CDD stands for Community Development District. When a developer comes into an area and decides to put single-family houses in a large tract of land, the cost of working on all the sewer lines, electrical, roads, and other related infrastructure can be extreme. To help with this, some developers get financing for the development and create an individual lien against each property or lot. That way, when they later sell the lot with a house to a homeowner, that homeowner inherits the debt and begins to pay it like the developer was prior to selling it.“CDD fees can be broken down into monthly figures, which allows you to figure out if you think it’d be worthwhile to live in a different community without such fees.”Typically you can find your CDD fees on your tax bill as a separate line item from your real estate taxes. CDD fees have two parts: 1) the maintenance fee, which is paid in perpetuity to pay for the amenities associated with the area; and 2) the financing fee, which has an interest rate associated with it and can be paid off.Around 10 years ago, there was pushback against CDD fees, but now, people realize the benefits of living in a community with a CDD fee attached. CDD fees can be broken down into monthly figures, which allows you to figure out if you think it’d be worthwhile to live in a different community without such fees. Is the money you’d save worth it to live in a community without the amenities?If you have other questions about CDD fees or anything to do with real estate, feel free to reach out to us via phone or email.

Kairos. It’s in a retail shopping just west of Hodges Blvd on the north side of Beach Boulevard. They have a lot of great stuff on the menu, but I love their Kairos Quesadilla.3. Juice Tap. They have tasty salads and juices that are also budget-conscious. My favorite is the veggie-filled greek salad.4. Southern Roots Filling Station. If you’re in the Riverside Avondale area, check out this vegan restaurant. My favorite item they have is their quinoa and avocado protein bowl.5. True Food. This is a slightly more formal lunch gathering spot in the town center. My favorite item is the turkey burger.If you know a healthy lunch spot, I would love to hear it so that I can put it in our rotation.

        "content": "Here’s what brokerage transaction fees are and why you’re charged them.Have you bought or sold a home and wondered, “what is a real estate brokerage transaction fee?” Do I really have to pay this extra fee? Today I’ll be answering all of these questions.Real estate brokerage transaction fees have been around for a while; they’re extra fees at an office level. For example, a real estate office might decide that for all transactions, they’ll charge a certain transaction fee. Typically, it’s for administrative items, marketing, document storage, and other costs of these types that the office is incurring. If the real estate agent doesn’t charge the client this fee, they’ll have to pay it themselves. These fees can range anywhere from $150 to as high as $1,200 (which is crazy), but usually, it’s within the $200 to $300 range.We at ERA Heavener Realty do not charge a real estate brokerage transaction fee, so I’m a little biased against them. However, I wanted to share this information with you so that if you’re in a real estate transaction in the future with another group, you know what they are.“These fees can range anywhere from $150 to as high as $1,200.”So, do you have to pay these fees? I use this phrase often, and it applies here: Everything in real estate is negotiable. So if you’re in a transaction and being charged these fees, you can certainly go to the agent or brokerage and say you don’t want to pay it. They may say you have to in order to work with them, but it’s your decision as to whether you continue working with them or not.This fee should be disclosed to you by your agent before buying or selling a home. At 2:40 in the video above, you can see an example of what this fee looks like on your settlement statement.If you have questions about this fee, even if you’re in the middle of a transaction with another company, by all means, I’m happy to help and can talk you through how to handle it. Call or shoot me an email if you want to discuss transaction fees or any other real estate matter. I look forward to catching up with you.",

        "content": "Here’s how you can save money on your property taxes.If you’re wondering how to save money on your property taxes, there are a couple of ways to do so.First, you could always let someone else do it. There are several companies (First Coast Consultants, Property Tax Professionals, for example) dedicated to helping you lower your property taxes. Their primary focus is larger commercial properties, but they can help you as well, provided you’re willing to pay a fee.Second, establish that you have a discrepancy. If you can prove that the county is assessing your property for more than it’s worth, and thus charging you more in taxes than what you should be paying, then they’ll lower the value—and by extension, your taxes. If you decide on this option, give me a call; I’d be happy to craft a market analysis to help you state your case.“Now is the time to act to contest your property’s valuation.”Third, once a discrepancy is established, know when to act. August has just ended, so you should’ve received a notice of proposed taxes from the county by now telling you what they intend to tax you on this November. This means right now is the time to act if you want to contest your property’s valuation. You can contact the Value Adjustment Board either through the online form or by sending them an email.  Their offices are presently closed due to COVID-19.Finally, remember to fill out the proper paperwork. Make sure you fill out the petition form completely and correctly when contesting your assessed value. There’s a slight fee involved, but it’s well worth it if you can save thousands of dollars later.As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

They want the best price, the fewest number of headaches, and they want things on their schedule. As a buyer in a seller’s market, here are some tips for how you can best construct an offer that gets the deal done.Ideally, sellers want their highest-priced offer to be a cash offer. However, only 25% of transactions in our MLS over the past year have been cash deals.So…  If you’re a buyer that’s getting financing, how can you make your offer more attractive to a seller?You could waive your appraisal contingency, or add verbiage to the agreement that shows your willingness to cover an appraisal gap. This will reassure the seller that you are doing what you can to offer as few headaches as possible.“Sellers want the best price, the fewest number of headaches, and they want things on their schedule.”Next.  There are a multitude of ways to reflect to a seller that you will be a stress-free buyer.  Today we’re focusing on one.  The inspection contingency.  You could shorten the timeline.  Offer to buy the home “as is.”  Or, waive the inspection contingency entirely (not that I’m suggesting that).  Last but not least.  The seller wants everything accomplished on their timeline. They likely want to close on a particular date because of the stress and hassle of moving. Sellers appreciate you giving them a few days after closing to move.If you have any real estate questions at all, feel free to reach out to me and my team. We’re here to help you.",

        "content": "Here are my tips for the new homeowners coming to live in Florida.Instead of talking about real estate, today I want to discuss the elephant in the room: Hurricane season is here. With all of the new residents coming to Florida from the Northeast, the Midwest, and the West Coast, I thought I should give our new neighbors some info on what to do if there is a hurricane on its way.Hurricane season in Florida starts June 1 and goes until November 30. However, if you’ve been around here for a while, you’ll know that things don’t get ramped up until August, and typically things tend to wind down by the end of October. I’m not qualified to make those kinds of predictions though, so let’s look at someone who is. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) thinks that there is a 60% chance that we will have a more active than normal hurricane season this year.What should you do about it? Start by taking a look at properties that you own and see how they are situated in terms of their elevation. You can go to fema.gov/flood-maps to determine if you need flood insurance. Flood insurance covers rising water, while homeowners insurance covers water coming from any other direction. If you are in an area that requires flood insurance, get it. “Hurricane season is here.”What do you do once the storm hits? You may just want to get out of town depending on how bad the storm is going to be. Go to maps.coj.net/evsearch to see what evacuation zone your home is in. If you decide to stay put, make sure you have the supplies necessary in case things go awry. A simple search for hurricane kits on Amazon yields all sorts of results.The city of Jacksonville has prepared a guide for how to respond during a hurricane.

Median sales price in our MLS.  The median price for single-family houses has risen consistently over the past 10 years.2. Inventory. The number of houses people are buying per month compared to how many houses are presently available in our market continues (absorption rate) to decrease. Where there is not enough supply and demand is still strong, prices go up.“Money is cheap to borrow, inventory is low, and we have a ton of demand for real estate.”3. Interest rates. Over the last 35 to 40 years, interest rates have been on a steady decline. Today they’re hovering around or below 3%. This is as low as rates have ever been.4. New construction.  Today we have a larger population and less new construction happening. For example, between 2011 and 2012 there were about 500,000 new homes being built per month. Back in the mid-1970s, around 2.5 million new homes were built per month. With all of these factors in play, unless something crazy happens with interest rates or new/existing home inventory coming on the market, we’re going to see a hot seller’s market for the next six to 12 months. I think that we will get back to a balanced market eventually, but that’s just not going to happen tomorrow.I hope this was helpful.

        "title": "What's the Difference Between an Earnest Money Deposit and a Down Payment?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here’s the difference between earnest money deposits and down payments.Every industry has its own terminology, which can often be confusing for those not in the know. Real estate is no different. However, conflating two different financial requirements can cause major problems during a transaction. What’s the difference between an earnest money deposit and a down payment?Sometimes referred to as ‘good faith money’ or even a ‘binder’ deposit, the earnest money deposit is simply money set aside by the buyer to demonstrate to the seller that they’re serious. By purposefully putting some of their skin in the game, the buyer shows that they’re committed to getting the deal done.As far as the state of Florida is concerned, a contract must have what’s known as ‘consideration’ to be deemed complete. That’s the role this earnest money deposit plays—it’s the consideration in the deal. Rather than going straight to the seller’s pocket, this deposit is typically held by a title company, an attorney, or sometimes a real estate brokerage involved in the deal. If the buyer exits the deal for a contractual reason (e.g., an inspection or financing contingency), then they will receive their earnest money back. Conversely, if the buyer decides to back out of the deal for a non-contractually protected reason, then the seller gets to keep the earnest money.“Your down payment represents the initial equity you have in your house when you purchase it.”The down payment, on the other hand, is the buyer’s way to demonstrate their seriousness to the lender who’s financing their purchase. (If there’s no lender involved, then there’s no down payment). The down payment is the difference between the purchase price of the home and the amount of money the buyer is borrowing from the lender. For example, if you’re buying a home worth $1 million, but you’re only borrowing $800,000, then you’d have a $200,000 down payment.Okay, so here’s one of the slightly confusing parts: The earnest money that’s being held by a third party gets rolled into the total down payment amount at closing. They’re coordinated, but they still serve different purposes.Another distinguishing factor is that the down payment amount can differ depending on the type of loan being used. A VA loan, for example, is 100% financing, meaning there’s a 0% down payment. An FHA loan typically requires a 3.5% down payment, while conventional loan requirements generally range from 5% to 20%. Your down payment represents the initial equity you have in your house when you purchase it.I hope you found this video to be helpful.

Therefore, the HAI provides us with a more holistic view of what’s going on in the real estate market and helps homebuyers understand their true purchasing power.I always keep up with this report because it offers some incredibly useful information. At 1:35 in the video above, you’ll be able to see an example of this index (for simplicity’s sake, we’ll be checking out the national numbers, as our local Jacksonville market would require a lot more digging). The higher the affordability index number, the more purchasing power consumers have in the real estate market. The lowest this index ever got was back in 2006 when it hit just above 100 nationally. That meant it was particularly difficult for people to purchase a home at a median price point based on incomes because prices were quite high and interest rates were too.“The HAI provides us with a more holistic view of what’s going on in the real estate market.”On the other hand, the highest this index ever got was in 2013, when it topped out at 210 or so—a phenomenal time to be a homebuyer. A comparison of the data from 2017 through 2020 reveals that home affordability has remained relatively stable even with rising home prices. In October 2020, the last month for which we have complete data, the index stood at 167.2, as compared to 157.9 in 2017. There is a shortage of inventory in most markets but demand remains high thanks to low interest rates; consequently, prices just keep rising, which has, in turn, kept the home affordability index from going up by a larger degree.The market has a funny way of balancing out all of these complex, interconnected variables. While the HAI has certainly changed over the past few years, those changes have not been dramatic.If you’re curious to see this interesting concept applied to your selling and buying plans, feel free to reach out by phone or email anytime. I’d be happy to break these numbers down further and explain what they may mean for your particular circumstances and goals. I’m here to help, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Sure enough, though, I soon started seeing articles in real estate publications about the coming insurance rate climb, so I’ve invited Danny to chat publicly about the problem and discuss potential solutions for homeowners.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Multiple offers are a nice problem; here are some tips that will help.If you’ve paid any attention to the news lately regarding real estate, you know we’re in a very hot seller’s market. Due to this, houses that are listed in a good area and are priced appropriately will have multiple offers. How do you navigate these offers and pick the best one? Here are my tips:1. Take a look at the environment you’re in. Calculate the absorption rate first, which is the measure of supply and demand for your particular area. If you look back at the previous six months of sales, it will give you a better idea. For example, let’s say you live in a planned-unit development that has had 10 sales in the last six months with two active listings. We know that they’re selling just shy of two units per month and can come to the conclusion that you have just over one month of inventory. In a normal market, there are around six months of inventory. When inventory is significantly less than 6 months you are in a strong sellers market.  And, the opposite is true, when it rises above 6 months you’re in a buyers market. 2. Time the listing. We like to do this so that our clients are appropriately navigating the market. We want to get the most traffic without losing the initial drive and demand for a new listing. I like to list homes on Thursdays because a majority of buyers want to look at homes in person on the weekend. Putting your home online on a Thursday gives buyers two days to find it, another day or so to make an offer on it, and another day or so for you to accept that offer. By Monday, your home could be under contract.“Buyers are motivated to buy well-priced, move-in ready homes.”3. Put your best foot forward. In the past, I’ve seen plenty of houses hitting the market before they’re ready and still try to get top dollar. You can’t do that in today’s market. Buyers are motivated, but they’re motivated to buy a move-in ready home that doesn’t need a lot of work.4. Plan the response. Once you receive all your offers and analyze the price and terms of each to figure out which is the best offer for your situation, it’s time to negotiate!5. Negotiate. Many sellers think you just have to pick the highest-priced offer. Inevitably, there is not always a clear winner when many bidders are involved. One offer could have a higher price but come with a contingency. You can go back to this buyer and let them know you like their offer, but won’t accept it with the contingency, for example.These are my best tips for navigating this crazy market as a seller.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "So how do you improve your offer without simply raising your price?Here are some key tips to help you find success as a buyer in today’s market—without simply paying more for the home you want:1. Be flexible with your timeline. Being flexible means, being willing to close sooner or later, depending on what the seller wants. If necessary, sellers might ask to stay in the house for a bit longer after closing. That may not be ideal, but if it doesn’t cost you more money and it gets the deal done, it’s something to consider.2. Raise your earnest money amount. Sellers typically see this as a sign that the buyer is serious. Since the buyer won’t get that money back if they back out of the deal for some non-contractual reason.3. Shorten or remove your contingencies. Your could shorten the inspection contingency from it’s usual 10 days down 7, as an example. Additionally, you could shorten the financing contingency to put the sellers mind at ease well in advance of closing.4. Move fast. I’ve had multiple deals recently where a buyer will find a property they like one day, only to find out that it has several offers on it the next day. If you want your deal done, in today’s market, you have to move very quickly.5. Share your story. I’m not a sentimental person myself, but sentimentality does often mean something to homeowners. Especially if they’ve lived in that home as their primary residence for a long time. To know that the next group that’s going to live there, take care of it, and be as attentive to it as the owners themselves were can make all the difference in a seller’s decision to accept an offer. Write them a letter and share relevant details about your life that you think would be compelling to the owner and their situation.6. Be fully approved. The pandemic has created a mess for mortgage companies and banks as they approve buyers to get loans. You can go all of the way through the underwriting process prior to making offers. That way, the seller won’t have to worry about the deal falling through for some underwriting issue later on during the deal’s timeline.If you have any questions or would like more information about how to successfully navigate a deal in today’s market, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Who pays for which closing costs in a real estate transaction?Before I answer that question, a quick reminder: there is no law stating which party has to pay a particular cost. What we’re talking about is the customary costs for a particular location. Different market areas have different customs.The following is what’s customary for sellers to pay in Northeast Florida:  Deed stamps: This state tax constitutes 0.007% of the sale price. It’s a set rate, so there’s no negotiating it.  Owners title insurance policy: This is also a state-regulated amount that basically provides insurance to the new buyer so that if any issues arise from previous ownership, it’s taken care of by the title insurance company.  Title search: The title company, in general, will handle the transaction as a whole, including the search and organizing the title insurance policy, which brings me to our next item…  Settlement fee: This is what the title company charges for doing the work mentioned above and handling the money, which goes from the lender to the seller, and then the seller to their lender, and so on.  Survey fee: This shows the buyer what they actually own.Other costs that are sometimes asked of seller’s to pay include: the satisfaction of the mortgage (if they have one) to pay off their existing loan, courier fees, wire fees, a home warranty, seller paid closing costs on behalf of the buyer, etc.Typically, buyers pay for anything associated with getting financing in Northeast Florida, so if you’re paying cash to purchase your home, your closing costs are minimal (recording fees, wiring fees, etc.). If you’re using financing to purchase though, you’ll be expected to cover several fees in addition to that:  Intangible tax: This is a tax on getting a mortgage, and it goes toward the state coffers. 0.002 * the loan amount.  Note stamps: This is like the deed stamps, except against the amount of the loan just a different amount. 0.0035 * loan amount.  Mortgagee title insurance policy: This is similar to the owner’s title insurance policy, except it protects the lender.  Title insurance endorsements: These are smaller modifications to your title insurance policy that protect you from issues that might arise if you live in a homeowners association or condominium complex, as an example.  Inspection fees: Whether it’s a general inspection, WDO inspection, pool inspection, etc., these are usually paid outside of the closing.   Mortgage origination charges: When you borrow money from a bank or mortgage company, this is the fee you pay them for originating your loan.  Appraisal fee: This is the fee you pay your lender so they can hire an appraiser to substantiate the amount you’re paying for the home.  Mortgage Insurance: This applies if you’re putting less than 20% down. Depending on the loan type, different terminology is used to describe the same function.  On FHA loans it’s MIP (mortgage insurance premium). For a VA loan, this is referred to as a funding fee.Other miscellaneous buyer costs can include:  Home warranty fee  Lender’s flood certification  Wire fee  Municipal lien search fee  Estoppel letter feeTo see a more in-depth description of these costs, follow this link that takes you to my blog post.

        "content": "I’m sharing our latest market update as well as how to come up with the absorption rate for your neighborhood.Recently, I was analyzing what happened in 2019 in our real estate market. I was examining all the statistics, getting a feel for how 2019 went, and how it could impact 2020. I came across a few essential facts that I felt you should know.The absorption rate, or inventory level, is the measure of how many homes we have for sale versus how many we’re selling per month. In 2019, the absorption rate ebbed and flowed between 3.8 and 3.2 months. To take this measurement for your neighborhood, you would want to look at the number of active listings against the number of homes sold in the previous 6 months (averaged). For example, if there are 10 active listings and 30 houses sold (over 6 months), you divide 30 by 6 which equals 5 per month.  Then divide 10 by 5 to give us 2 months of inventory.“I’m curious and excited to see what happens in 2020.”Currently, we have 3.2 months of inventory, which means in about three months, all of our current listings will be sold (not considering those pulling their houses off of the market). A few other factors come into play, but that is the basis for these figures. This low number is great for sellers but can be tough for buyers. As a buyer, this means a property might fetch multiple offers when it comes on the market.The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is currently in the mid 3’s, which is going to fuel the market. As long as mortgage rates are that low and inventory is low, prices won’t slow down much.I’m curious and excited to see what happens in 2020. Many factors can change up these numbers, so we’ll see how our real estate market ebbs and flows as we move through the year.If you’re wondering what your home is worth, what you can get for the money as a buyer, or you just want to have a conversation about any of these statistics, feel free to call or email me.

        "content": "Let's take a look at the pros and cons of renting versus owning.I’m very much into putting some math behind major buying decisions (jobs, houses, cars, trips, etc.).  I found 2 sites that did a good job of objectively laying out the various costs associated with homeownership. Resource 1Resource 2Once you have that in hand, you can make a decision based on the facts, not just the hype of homeownership (as I see so often). You may not have heard a Realtor talk about the merits of renting over owning, but there are some worth mentioning. For example, if you’re in a temporary living situation (e.g., job relocation, military, or a growing family), not being tied down is preferable. Another plus for renters is that they don’t have to stress about the labor and costs associated with maintenance. If you plan to be in one location for the long haul, then ownership is your best option. As an owner, you pay down the principal balance on your home loan each month, whereas renters face nothing but rising rental costs with no asset to show for it. Secondly, if you’re seeking to live in a desirable community, it may be the case that there are few (if any) rental properties available. Based on where you’re looking, ownership may be your only option.“If you plan to be in one location for the long haul, then ownership is your best option.”Lastly, a property that you own is one that you can make your own; it’s part of the American Dream to own a home and customize it to reflect your lifestyle. A lot of deciding whether you should rent or buy comes down to the math (i.e., the cost of renting versus the mortgage payment and maintenance costs associated with ownership).  If you or anyone you know is currently pondering this decision, please feel free to call or email me. I’d love to have that conversation and help you think about all the implications.",

        "title": "A Quick Guide to How Real Estate Agents Get Paid",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here’s a quick breakdown of how real estate agents get paid.How do real estate agents get paid?1. To answer that question, let’s first address who pays a real estate agent. Roughly 99% of the time, it’s the seller. In fact, in my 12 years as an agent, I can’t ever remember a transaction where the buyer paid an agent’s commission. This doesn’t mean it never takes place, but it’s not customary in our Northeast Florida market. There are two portions of each commission the seller pays: the portion that goes to their listing agent and the portion that’s offered to any buyers’ agents in the area so that they bring in interested buyers. 2. All agents and brokerages have to abide by the Sherman Antitrust Act, which is intended to prevent price-fixing. In other words, it’s illegal for one real estate company to go to another company and establish an average commission rate for a transaction. If you ask an agent what the average commission is and they’re finicky about answering, that’s why. There is no such thing as an “average” commission. Each brokerage sets their own commission rate. 3. It’s also important to note that agents don’t get paid directly. The commission the seller pays goes straight to the agents’ brokerage.  The agent is then paid a portion of the commission from the brokerage.  So, different companies may have different commission rates.  And different agents within the company may have different commission splits.  This is another thing that’s negotiable.  “There’s a difference between what you pay and the value you receive.”4. Finally, there is a difference between cost and value. Some agents might be a great “value” for the “cost.” Others, not so much. For example, Gardner Minshew II, the Jacksonville Jaguars’ current starting quarterback (though not for long), will make about $700,000 this year. He ranks 12th in terms of overall quarterback rating. One slot behind Tom Brady, but way ahead of Jared Goff of the Los Angeles Rams. Jared’s QBR ranks 27th in the league, but he stands to earn $26 million this year. Basically, the Jaguars are paying Minshew 37x less than what the Rams are paying Goff, and getting better overall results!That is to say, there’s a difference between what you pay and the value you receive. To find out what value an agent brings to the table, research their experience and performance history: how many homes they sell per year, how their sale price compares to each home’s list price, what their average days on market is, etc. If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.",

        "content": "Despite the fact that the fall market tends to slow after the rush of the summer. There are still multiple reasons why this time of year is a great time to buy a home:1. Sellers are more motivated in the fall. Compared to those in the spring and summer, fall home sellers have more motivation to sell. No one wants strangers traipsing through their home during the Thanksgiving season!There are also fewer homes on the market. Looking at the numbers, in January of 2019, there were 1,530 closed residential transactions in our MLS.  In May this year, that number was 2,992; and the months of June, July, and August were all about the same, at 2,700.2. You’ll have more of your agent’s attention. Summer is always more busy for real estate agents. Keeping track of all the activity is more challenging because there’s twice as much work in the summer. But in the fall and winter, when activity slows down, it’s easier for your agent to devote more of their attention to you.3. The weather. Sweating through the afternoon looking at houses just isn’t fun!  When things get a bit more cool and breezy it makes the house hunting process much more enjoyable.“In Jacksonville, the fall and winter temperatures tend to hover around 72 degrees, which is excellent house-hunting weather.”If you have any questions about buying a home in the fall, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

It’s true. Thankfully, by following just a few simple tips, you can make sure that your repair negotiations go smoothly and successfully.“Repair-related disagreements are the second-most common reason real estate deals fall apart.”Here are our top three tips: 1. Take your emotions out of the equation. Buying and selling real estate can be a very emotional experience.  This we know.  But, it’s important to remain objective and level-headed when you talk about repairs. If, for example, you’re selling your home and a buyer complains about a detail of your home that you don’t see an issue with.  Try to remove your personal biases and see things from their perspective. You don’t necessarily have to resolve the problem, but you should at least consider it.2. Get everything in writing. Our Northeast Florida Association of Realtors Purchase Agreement states that, “all work will be completed by appropriately licensed individuals.” If you, as the seller, plan on doing some of the work yourself.  Be sure to get it in writing and agreed upon by the buyer!  Otherwise, you’ve breached the contract and risk losing the deal.  Similarly, be as detailed as possible with the items that are being repaired.  I’ve seen many a scuffle begin because of unmet expectations around how a particular home maintenance task was accomplished.  Putting all agreements into writing (with as much detail as possible) will help both parties avoid unpleasant surprises when closing day arrives.3. Resolve repair requests through a credit rather than by completing repairs. Often, having the seller offer the buyer a closing cost credit is a better option than trying to orchestrate repairs prior to closing. Alternatively, the seller may adjust the purchase price to compensate for the amount the buyer will have to spend on repairs.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Every year, the county gives you an opportunity to challenge your assessed value (and potentially lower your annual real estate tax bill).  Whether it’s an investment property or a primary residence. I’ve actually challenged the assessment of my property values several times, which have been rental properties for the most part.A few years ago, I bought a rental property for $100,000 (keeping the numbers round for simplicity). One year later, the assessment came out, and it valued my property at $150,000, meaning that I’d pay more in property taxes than I’d expected to. I had paid a little bit under market value for it, but it also needed a bunch of work done. So I established my case for challenging the assessment—I gathered up some comparable sales that demonstrated my property was not worth as much as the county said.  Showing that in its present condition it was worth substantially less.  Then I sent that information to the county.Sure enough, they agreed that my home wasn’t worth that amount, and they ended up reducing their assessment to something closer to the $100,000 I had originally paid for it. The difference saved me about $1,000 per year in property taxes.Something else to note is that the county can increase the assessed value of your property if it isn’t your primary residence by 10% each year. If it is your primary residence, then they can only increase its assessed value by 3% per year. That can still be a big deal if you own the property for awhile. By challenging the assessment on my property, I saved $1,000 not only that year, but every year after that, and I still own it to this day.If you’re thinking of challenging your property’s assessed value, now is the right time of year to do so. In August, the county will open up the opportunity for you to submit the application to lower your taxes. The Value Adjustment Board will give you until the middle of September to send in your application, which can be accessed here.“If you’re thinking of challenging your own property’s assessed value, now is the right time of year to do so.”If you’re unsure of the value of your home, reach out to me.

By following this process yourself, you’ll be sure to find the right contractor for your needs in no time. This process contains four simple steps: 1. Look for contractors by talking to friends and family, by looking online, or by reaching out to trusted local professionals, like your Realtor. Once you’ve identified a few candidates, you can move on to the next step.Here are some websites to help you locate professionals:https://www.homeadvisor.com/https://www.thumbtack.com/https://www.angieslist.com/2. Fact-checking. Before you even think of hiring a contractor, you need to make sure they’re licensed, insured, and that they pull the proper permits when handling various projects. This will give you a better idea of their legitimacy.Here are some helpful websites:https://apps8.fldfs.com/proofofcoverage/Search.aspxhttps://buildinginspections.coj.net/https://www.myfloridalicense.com/wl11.asp?mode=0&amp;SID=3. Create a competition between the vendors you’re thinking of hiring. When a contractor knows they aren’t your only option, this may incentivize them to put their best foot forward. Not only that, but comparison shopping is a great way to ensure you earn the best possible deal. 4. Don’t pay for the entire job up front. While you should certainly expect to pay a deposit when you begin working with a contractor, paying the entire bill before the work is finished is not a wise choice. “While you should certainly expect to pay a deposit when you begin working with a contractor, paying the entire bill before the work is finished is not a wise choice.”If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

That’s where people get confused. They might not exactly have your best interest in mind. This is because transaction brokerage relationships lack these four things: loyalty, confidentiality, obedience, and full disclosure. On the other hand, all of these things are present with single agency.“Single agency is the way to go.”How can you get the best deal for you and your family if you’re working with someone who doesn’t give you loyalty, confidentiality, obedience, and full disclosure? The answer is that you can’t. This is an issue that just doesn’t get enough attention so I wanted to bring it to yours today. The next time you are hiring a real estate agent, single agency is obviously the right way to go. If you have any questions for me in the meantime about single agency, the market, or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "What’s the deal with instant offer companies that seem to be popping up all over the place lately? These companies, also known as “iBuyers,” may be a viable option for some, but before you take the plunge into such an arrangement, there are a few points to consider.Opendoor, Zillow, and OfferPad are some of the most prominent companies behind this trend, but it’s important not to conflate brand recognition with trustworthiness. In short, just because you’ve heard of Zillow, that doesn’t mean selling to them is a good idea. “Unless you’re interested in throwing away money, you’re better off pursuing a traditional selling experience.”So what exactly are instant offer companies doing? In short, they buy homes for between 10% and 20% below market value (on average), claiming that this arrangement is more convenient for sellers than listing on the open market. The truth is that these iBuyers are really just looking to make a quick buck. Their plan is to offer you a “convenient” arrangement at a cost. Sure, by selling to an iBuyer you get to avoid the listing process, but is that worth the inordinately low price you’ll earn for your home as a result?Unless you’re interested in throwing away money, then no. You’re almost always better off pursuing a traditional selling experience.

In the event of a natural disaster, you’ll know how high your home’s elevation is. By using this map, you’ll be able to ascertain the elevation of your potential home and, therefore, determine whether the home would be underwater if a natural disaster were to strike. It will also give you an idea of how high the home sits relative to your neighbors. 2. You can decide where to go in the event of a storm. Relatedly, you can rely on this tool if and when you’re in the path of a storm. If circumstances dictate that you need to evacuate and seek shelter elsewhere, the map will give you a sense of the elevation of your relatives’ properties as well. In turn, you can determine whose is the highest and head that direction. 3. You can see how to best landscape your yard. If it’s time to restructure your yard’s landscaping or, say, you have a recurring issue with runoff in just one spot, this tool can aid you in mapping out how to eliminate the problem, given your home’s elevation. Starting at 1:55 in the video, you can view my step-by-step guide on how to use the Duval Civil Planning Map.  If you have any suggestions for future video topics or you have any real estate-related questions for me, please give me a call at 904-405-1995.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Florida Bar Board Certified elder law attorney Kellen Bryant joins me today to discuss an important financial investments and savings rental property exception that you might want to know about.To Kellen, Florida is one of the nicer states when it comes to how they treat a lot of Medicaid and rental property rules. These two areas tie together because if you need nursing home care and you have a rental property that would count against you getting the care that you need, you’ll have to sell your home on the fly, which can be a loss.In Florida, however, there are some things you need to do relating to that property, but you don’t have to sell it in order to qualify for skilled nursing care. Here, the rules are reversed: Florida allows you to pay with cash to purchase an income-producing property—cash that generally counts against people when it comes to nursing home qualification. This is called the  income-producing property exception, which is a noncountable asset when it comes to your financial eligibility to receive Medicaid to help pay for a nursing home.There are two main catches when it comes to this strategy, however. 1. Any kind of net profit relating to this rental property has to go toward your nursing home copay.2. If the deed is not set up correctly to create an enhanced life estate or ladybird deed, then the state of Florida can set up a lien on the property at the time of the owner’s death.“There are a lot of details underneath the surface, but when done correctly, this is a good way to protect your assets.”Here’s a good example of how the income-producing property exception might work:Suppose a family is taking a loved one to go into a nursing home facility. Let’s say that loved one has $300,000 cash in the bank, and the family decides to use that money to pay the nursing home. When that money runs out, they then apply for Medicaid. The above-mentioned strategy would allow the family members to instead take that cash to go buy a rental property to then use for the cost of nursing care.It’s not advisable to pursue this strategy on your own. To do it properly and ensure a seamless process with no liens, you need to do it under the auspice of an experienced elder law attorney. In the example laid out above, you wouldn’t necessarily need to spend all $300,000 on the rental property, as one of the disadvantages of choosing this route is that your money becomes tied up in the real estate process. But this way, the cash is protected, and you have a reliable stream of income going toward your loved one’s nursing care.If you have any questions about this exception, reach out to Kellen at (904) 470-2300, or visit his website at https://www.bbelderlaw.com/.For other real estate questions or suggestions for future topics, you can always reach out to ERA Heavener Realty.

        "content": "All square footage is not equal—this is a crucial detail that is sometimes lost on us as we try to decipher how another home compares to our own.  Strategically pricing your home depends on making savvy decision around this idea.  When trying to come up with a reasonable price per square foot on your property, the price your neighbor sold for may not necessarily be “apples to apples.” Factors like the lot itself, any renovations made on the home, and the nature of the square footage all have to be taken into account.“There’s so much to consider when determining the price per square foot of your home, so be patient and try to get below the surface on assessing other comparable sales.”Let’s say you enclosed a garage to make a bonus room.  The additional square footage should not be treated the same as that of a larger home with a floor plan that’s more functional.  Intuitively we know this, but practically we like to forget it when it applies to ourselves.Online home valuation tools like Zillow are useful in giving a broad view of what homes are selling for in your area.  They’re less dependable when you need to be strategic with pricing your home based on the particulars and unique aspects of your situation.If you have any suggestions regarding future video content or would like help with any of your real estate needs whatsoever, feel free to give me a call.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "So what is the Dunning-Kruger Effect?Back in the late 90s, David Dunning and Justin Kruger, professors from Cornell College, did a study that concluded that the less an individual knows about a particular topic, the more likely they are to overvalue their skill, ability, or knowledge on that topic.Let me use an example from my own life to demonstrate the Dunning-Kruger Effect:Around 15 or 20 years ago, a friend of mine was having a conversation with his dad about the Gate River Run. My friend found out that he could win a substantial amount of money by winning the race. Now, my friend was not a runner; he was a good athlete, but people who win the Gate River Run average a mile in 4.5 minutes—they fly. My friend couldn’t run a single 4.5-minute mile, so his lack of knowledge about that topic led him to believe that he could just go out and win this race against professional athletes.That’s in essence what the Dunning-Kruger Effect is—you don’t know what you don’t know, which leads you to overvalue your competency. “That’s in essence what the Dunning-Kruger Effect is—you don’t know what you don’t know, which leads you to overvalue your competency.”In real estate, I see this often. We are in the Information Age where you can Google just about anything. I’m sure doctors have seen this as well: Many think that because they pulled information from WebMD, they know all about what’s wrong with them. In real estate, we have all this information in front of us, but the problem isn’t getting the information, but rather, knowing what to do with it.Quite frankly, after 12 years in this business, there are still houses, areas, neighborhoods, and problems that I still can’t say I know everything about. There are a lot of moving parts in real estate.So how does the Dunning-Kruger Effect apply to your life?Ask my wife—I am the worst about this. I often think I know more about a particular subject than I really do, and she is kind enough to remind me of that on a daily basis. Just remember that, as you’re going through your job, your relationships, and major life decisions, we can’t possibly know everything we need to know in order to make a perfect decision. We need the help of experts and the people around us to make important decisions, whether it’s about investing, healthcare, or real estate.If you have any questions or examples of the Dunning-Kruger Effect, feel free to reach out to me.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Today we’re taking a close look at the Jacksonville real estate market. We’ll go over how it performed in 2018 and what we have to look forward to in 2019.Overall, the market is still doing very well. We’ve seen an improving market since about 2013, and there’s no reason to think that things are going to fall out from under us in 2019, contrary to popular belief. To keep a close eye on things, we can look at inventory levels to know if things are still healthy. Inventory, sometimes referred to as “absorption rate,” is one of the best measures to use for understanding where the market is headed in the near future. Taking the total number of sales in a given price range, dividing by 12 to get an average monthly figure, then dividing the average monthly number into total active listings gives you the absorption rate/inventory level. The lower the number, the more the market is in favor of sellers. Most experts believe 6 months of inventory to be a healthy balance, where both buyer/seller negotiating strength is evenly distributed.“In summary, the market is very strong in most areas and price points.”We can also look at absorption rates, interest rates, and other economic factors to see what things look like on the horizon. To get all sorts of fun data on mortgage interest rates, check out this link: http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/data.htmlWhen you ask a Realtor or investor how the market is doing, really what you’re asking is how the market is doing for you, your home, and your neighborhood. All of the above factors I’ve mentioned need to be looked at for your specific property. For example, the market could be good for condos at the beach, but bad for multi-family homes on the west side. Each type of property, each location, and each price range is different.In summary, the market is very strong in most areas and price points. We’re either in a seller’s market or a balanced market. Mortgage interest rates remain low as well.If you have any questions for me about the market or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "If you haven’t already, there’s no time like the present to try some of these great breakfast spots on a Saturday morning: 1. Beach Hut Cafe - Situated just two blocks away from the beach, this diner/ breakfast spot isn’t necessarily high on the gourmet scale, but if respectable service and relatively low menu prices are what you’re looking for, it’s a decent spot. Consider this more of a local classic, if nothing else.2. Maple Street Biscuit Company - Since its arrival in Jacksonville not that long ago, this restaurant has been immensely popular, which has led to locations sprouting up all over the city and other parts of the Southeast. Some selling points are the assortment of biscuit options and the unconventional way in which they give you your order—by asking you zany questions like who your favorite superhero is or what you had for dinner the night before. 3. First Watch - A breakfast consisting of eggs and bacon doesn’t always make for the healthiest breakfast. For those that find avocado toast and juice blends with any number of fruits and vegetables to be more their style, this is the place. 4. Cool Moose Cafe - Admittedly, I haven’t tried this one out yet, but the collective voice of my Facebook friends indicates that you shouldn’t pass this spot up. Heavy on trendiness, keen attention to detail, and wonderfully flavorful dishes, this cafe likely boasts a lot of popularity for a reason.  5. Metro Diner - Similar to Maple Street, these diners have cropped up across Jacksonville. Good coffee, french toast, and exceptional service are all reasons to give this one a try sometime. Last but certainly not least, my honorable mention goes to Native Sun. It features the best weekend hot bar in the area with eggs, bacon, sausage, cinnamon rolls, pancakes, and more. It’s all good, and it’s all organic; not to mention, it’s never crowded! If you have questions about any of the places on my list or about places you should eat breakfast this weekend, feel free to contact me.

        "author": "",

        "content": "Buying a new construction home in our area isn’t the same as buying a normal resale home, so here are three tips you need to keep in mind that will save you time, money, and a few headaches down the road.First, be aware of the type of contract you’re working with. When buying a normal resale home in our area, most of the time you work with a contract that’s written for the Northeast Florida Association of Realtors by attorneys who are trying to be equitable to both the buyer and the seller. This isn’t the case when it comes to builder contracts, though. Builders have their own attorneys who write their contracts, and they’re written with the builder in mind.This isn’t a bad thing, but it is something you and your Realtor need to be aware of, so make sure you work with someone who’s familiar with the new construction process and can pinpoint contract items you may need to negotiate over.“Make sure you work with someone who’s familiar with the new construction process.”Second, don’t sign your purchase contract without visiting the builder’s design center first. You need to make sure you’re getting the same finishes you planned on paying for. The purchase price is not the final price you pay when it comes to new construction homes—you also have to pay for any upgrades, additions, etc. I’ve been on design center walkthrough appointments with buyers who had to shave off $20,000 to $30,000 in order to complete their purchase.Lastly, try to shop around for other lenders besides the builder’s. More often than not, the builder will offer you some sort of incentive if you use their lender to buy. You should try to get the builder to agree to allow you to shop for other lenders, get a competing quote, and use that competing quote if their lender can’t match it.If you’d like more tips for buying new construction or you have any other real estate needs, feel free to call or email me. I’d be happy to help you.",

			<p>You’re probably looking for someone to help you make a good decision on your next real estate transaction, yes? Theodore Roosevelt (our 26th President) has this quote that I love, “Every person who invests in well-selected real estate in a growing section of a prosperous community adopts the surest and safest method of becoming independent, for real estate is the basis of wealth.” If your aim is to improve your well being, and the well being of your family, then homeownership is a great way (if not the best way) to do it!</p>

<p>I’ve been working as a real estate agent since 2007 (prior to that I was in the mortgage business) and became the broker/owner of ERA Heavener Realty in 2011. At this point, I’m well past 400 closings in my career, and have personally bought/sold over 60 homes. In 2010 I was honored to have been nominated to the Jacksonville Business Journals 40 Under 40 crew. All of that to say, I’ve taken all of the bumps and bruises the real estate market has to offer, so that I can help you avoid them :)</p>

<p>In addition to real estate, I love traveling with my wife to cool places, hanging out with our little ones (Anniston, Miles, Ava, Lily, and Leighton), and playing basketball (even though I have lost a step… Or, two). </p>
